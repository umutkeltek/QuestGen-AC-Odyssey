    "General_Description": "'''One Bad Spartan Spoils the Bunch''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "As suggested by [[Brasidas]], Kassandra sought to appeal to King [[Archidamos of Sparta|Archidamos]] by ending the traitorous operation of arming the [[Slavery|enslaved]] ''[[helot]]s''.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way southwest uphill from [[Mesoa]] village. [[Ikaros]] helped her find and scan the [[Gorani Marble Quarry|quarry]] from the crossroad.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found them!''\nIkaros spotted leader of the traitors.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found him!''\nShe reached the entrance.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is the marble quarry Brasidas mentioned.''\nShe infiltrated through an opening on the palisade along the entrance, then made her way through the bushes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The weapons have to be here somewhere.''\nShe spied a weapon rack inside a dark-colored tent guarded by soldiers. Before she dispatched them, she reminded herself to be discreet.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's only one Spartan here that I need to kill. It'll be easier if I don't alert the others.''\nNevertheless, she destroyed the weapon rack.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One down, four to go.''\nKassandra moved further inside, being careful not to get detected. She spotted another one behind a {{Wiki|treadwheel crane|crane}} north of the quarry and dismantled it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's two. Time to find the others.''\nShe moved up a wooden ramp west, into a chamber with ladders and a hole above. She found a rack below a tower-like structure and broke it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Three weapon racks destroyed. Won't take much longer.''\nShe moved back out and down to a longer chamber southeast of the quarry. Kassandra moved in and quickly destroyed the fourth weapon rack.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Only one more to go.''\nKassandra caught glimpse of the leader wearing heavy soldier armor and assassinated him. She used a nearby pulley to lift herself up to the final rack. She destroyed it and escaped the quarry.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra assassinated the leader of the treasonous band of Spartans, and destroyed the weapon racks they were going to give to the ''helots''.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*This quest is missable. It is possible to go and meet the kings straightaway; doing this locks out One Bad Spartan Spoils the Bunch as well as [[Bully the Bullies]] quests, and grants instead [[A Legendary Hunt]] quest.\n*The name of this quest is a reference to the proverb \"one bad apple spoils the bunch\".",

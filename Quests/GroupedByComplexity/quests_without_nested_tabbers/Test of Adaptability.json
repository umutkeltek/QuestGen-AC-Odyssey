The owl knows. She's [[Minerva|Athena]]'s favorite bird, you know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here for the key to the vault.''\n*'''Hermit:''' ''Then what are you doing here? That's nearly ridiculous.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you're telling me it's not here.''\n*'''Hermit:''' ''I hid it somewhere safe. It's underwater in the [[Ariabignes Shipwreck]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That doesn't sound very safe.''\n*'''Hermit:''' ''How could it not be safe, surrounded by so many defenders?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why do I never get the easy jobs?''\n*'''Hermit:''' ''Whooo knows?''\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to the hermit once more.\n*'''Hermit:''' ''Good luck finding the key!''\nKassandra left for the shipwreck. Upon her arrival, Kassandra dealt with the \"defenders\" and found the Foundry of Hephaistos Tomb Key in the western portion of the sunken ship's hull.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found the key. Time to return to that strange woman.''\nWith the key recovered, she returned to the mysterious woman.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found your key. Your associate certainly kept it well-protected.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''He ought to have, I paid him well enough to do so.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where exactly are you getting your [[drachma]]e from?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''I have very few needs and spend only on what I find important. I'm very nearly thrifty.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now that I have the key, is there anything else I need to prepare to visit the island of fire?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''You tell me, ''misthios''. Do you feel prepared to explore the [[Foundry of Hephaistos]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait, you're not going to ask me a strange question first?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Perhaps I'll think of one later.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready to explore that island.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Very good. You are proving your worth.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Am I now? I'm impressed.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''There is an island swathed with clouds of smoke, where the earth blazes with fire. It's called the Foundry of Hephaistos. A [[Helmet of Gorgophone|legendary helmet]] is kept there. Bring it here so I might study it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Seems like a dangerous journey for just a helmet.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''It's not nearly the only treasure there. You can keep anything else you find.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll go to the island and find the helmet.''",

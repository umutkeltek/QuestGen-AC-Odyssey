Still, I have hope.''\nKassandra laughed at his remark, in turn.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're getting soft, Brasidas.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''When [[Leonidas I of Sparta|Leonidas]] died at the [[Hot Gates of Thermopylai|Hot Gates]], we all [[Greco-Persian Wars|came together against]] a common [[Achaemenid Empire|enemy]].

You keep searching the house.''\nKassandra bid farewell to Brasidas and followed them to the Scorched Tree. She followed the road they were taking and found the scorched tree. As she noticed a woman tied up, Kassandra eavesdropped on the Cult guards having a conversation.\n*'''Cult Guardian:''' ''I'm sick of this job.

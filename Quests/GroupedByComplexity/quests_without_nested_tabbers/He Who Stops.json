    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way northeast of Athens to [[Mt. Pentelikos Village]], then scanned the nearby [[Mt. Pentelikos Marble Quarry|quarry]]-turned-prison camp for Heremos with the help of [[Ikaros]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The messenger\u2014he's being held in that prison camp.''\nKassandra infiltrated the camp and made her way to the central watchtower from which Heremos was apparently hanging. She climbed the watchtower and confirmed that he was dead.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like I was too late for Heremos.''\nShe looked down at the cages and noticed some prisoners.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Huh, seems Kleon's messenger wasn't the only one captured. Maybe I can help them, too.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Heremos was dead long before Kassandra could rescue him, but she noticed other prisoners she could save.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Heremos's hanged body is loaded in the Pentelikos quarry even before the quest is begun, as early as the first time the player sets foot in Attika. The ship captain, however, is not loaded until this quest has begun, and while he can be carried out, he cannot be interacted with until this quest is completed.",

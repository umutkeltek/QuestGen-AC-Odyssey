They've been spotted killing people in Amphipolis at night\u2014a grisly sight. The Huntsman has a strong affinity with beasts.

    "Section_Trivia": "*Completing this quest changes the dialogue just before battling the [[Pactyas (Ancients)|Huntsman]] during [[Protector of Persia]], as well as deprives him of the alpha wolf that will attack alongside him in that fight.\n*The quest remains available even after completing 'Protector of Persia.'  However, Kassandra will not have any dialogue upon killing the last wolf; the quest will simply complete.",

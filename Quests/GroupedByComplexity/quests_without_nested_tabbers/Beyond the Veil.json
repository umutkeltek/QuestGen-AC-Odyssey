    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled to the northeast of the [[Theion Pits]] in the [[Mourning Fields]] and found [[The Poisoner|the Poisoner of Athens]]. She engaged him in combat.\n*'''The Poisoner:''' ''[[Perikles]]' pet! Oh, how I've waiting for this day.''<br />''I am going to fill your veins with the venom of a thousand snakes.''\nKassandra dealt a few blows to the Poisoner.\n*'''The Poisoner:''' ''You failed to save Perikles. When I'm done, I'll send him your body!''\nKassandra dealt a killing blow to the Poisoner.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was the hired killer who tried poisoning politicians in [[Athens]].''\nConfirming the kill, Kassandra retrieved a [[Helmet of the Fallen|helmet]] from the corpse. She also retrieved a note that provided a clue to the next target.\n*'''The Poisoner's Note:''' ''Despite my best attempts to poison my Athenian enemies, the [[Plague of Athens|plague]] was a far more ruthless killer than I ever was. No matter. The ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]] delivered me to my own [[Elysium]] of venom and decay. Here on my throne of snakes, I drink from the helm of [[Hades]]' fallen servant. A [[Epiktetos|wild-eyed zealot]] took the servant's [[Waistband of the Fallen|belt]] south of here, underneath my favorite tree in all the underworld. It seems we both share a fondness for the vile and the fanged.''\nFollowing the clue, Kassandra traveled south and entered [[Orphis Lair]], encountering Epiktetos the Forthcoming.\n*'''Epiktetos:''' ''I can still feel [[Deimos]] smashing my head against the artifact. Thanks to the power Deimos gave me, I am immortal!''\nKassandra dealt a few blows to Epiktetos.\n*'''Epiktetos:''' ''After I kill you, Deimos is next.''\nKassandra dealt a killing blow to Epiktetos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Epiktetos... The one my brother killed to spare me.''\nConfirming the kill, Kassandra retrieved the Waistband of the Fallen from the corpse, along with another note.\n*'''Epiktetos' Note:''' ''The pyramid is cold. Its light is gone... the light... THE LIGHT! The light is in my head now. That fool Deimos thought he could kill me, but by smashing my skull, he forced the artifact's power into my very being. I now transcend mortality and communicate with [[Kosmos]]. I will rally my [[Cult of Kosmos|brothers and sisters]]\u2014starting with the cruel [[Boeotia]]n [[Deianeira|woman]]. She walked north in the fallen servant's [[Boots of the Fallen|boots]] and was spotted worshipping the [[Titan]]s. Or perhaps challenging them.''\nFollowing the clue, Kassandra traveled to the northwest of the underworld, through [[Chasm of Torment]] to the [[Altars of the Titans]], where she encountered [[Deianeira]] and [[Astra]] once again.\n*'''Deianeira:''' ''Come to fight a real champion, have you?''<br />''I will mount your pretty head on a spear.''\nKassandra dealt a few blows to Deianeira.\n*'''Deianeira:''' ''No one bests a Boeotian champion. No one!''\nKassandra dealt a killing blow to Deianeira.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Deianeira... You're shorter than I remember.''\nKassandra then finished off Astra and confirmed Deianeira's kill, retrieving [[Boots of the Fallen|boots]] from her corpse. In addition, she recovered a note leading to a fallen hero.\n*'''Astra's letter to Deianeira:''' ''My dearest cousin,<br />I feel your dissatisfaction. We carved our place in the underworld, and now no one dares stand in our way. Even the Titans will not rise to meet our challenge. We are blades, my dear cousin. If left unused, we will rust. But I may have found us a worthy opponent. When [[Perseus|he]] was alive his greatest trophy was the head of a [[Gorgon|monster]]. Now in death, he basks in his former glory to the east in the Scorched Lands. Let's show him what monsters we can be, and use his head as our trophy.''\n\n(Note: the following dialogue runs concurrent with [[Death Before Dishonor]])\n\nKassandra traveled back south to the Mourning Fields, finding the [[Swordfish]] in the [[Burned Temple of Moira]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Swordfish will have the Athenian's sword.''\nKassandra engaged him in combat.\n*'''Swordfish:''' ''I've been waiting for you, ''misthios.<br />''Come to be food for the sharks? So be it.''\nKassandra dealt a few blows to the Swordfish.\n*'''Swordfish:''' ''[[Poseidon]], give me strength.''\nKassandra dealt a killing blow to the Swordfish.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Back to swimming with the fishes!''\nConfirming the kill, Kassandra retrieved a [[Chestplate of the Fallen|chestplate]] and a sword from his corpse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the sword.''\nShe also retrieved a note leading to a fallen hero.\n*'''Swordfish's note:''' ''They have followed me. Even into the asshole of the underworld, the Cult still follows. I did their bidding in life, and now in death they still demand servitude. I will never bow to them again. I am already in Hades' good graces. If I find guardians for his gates, I am sure to gain a stronger position still. The [[Agamemnon|king]] who slayed his own [[Iphigenia|daughter]] to win a [[Trojan War|war]] is rumored to dance among the flames in the [[Pit of Deprivation]]. I intend to pay him a little visit.''",

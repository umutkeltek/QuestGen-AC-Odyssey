End that [[Piracy|pirate]] ship's reign of terror at all costs.''\"\n#\"''No one can catch the [[Flying Ikaros]] once the wind blows its sails. Some even say it doesn't sail but flies on the horizon. A reward awaits the captain who'll break this pirate ship's wings.''\"\n#\"''Veteran smugglers man the mighty ship known as the [[Hekate's Grace]].

No one knows where they came from, but there's [[drachma]]e for whoever stops their safe return home.\"''\n#\"''Named for the {{Wiki|old man of the sea}}, [[Old Nereus]] is a living legend for veterans, for he carries the name of a fallen god... and the pirates aboard him perpetuate some unspeakable actions that must end.''\"\n#\"''The nefarious pirates aboard the [[Shadowed Nymph]] have evaded the [[Delian League]] long enough. [[Athens]] offers a hefty reward to the worthy captain who sends those filthy pirates to [[Hades]].\"''\n#\"''Sailing from the southeast, the pirate ship [[Palaityros]] constantly harasses [[merchant]] boats and disrupts trade around the world. Put an end to its mischief.''\"\n#\"''The pirate ship [[Tartessos]] is said to originate from the {{Wiki|Pillars of Hercules|pillars of Herakles}} and often ventures into our sacred Aegean Sea to attack merchant ships. Kick it back to where it came from.''\"",

I can't deal with him openly so I need him to have a bad run-in with a [[mercenary]].\"\n#\"The Athenian who ordered my brave son killed to cover up his own mistakes. Give him to the [[crow]]s.\"\n#\"The bastard Athenian thinks he can take whatever he wants from the poor. Well I can afford a bounty. Take from him.''(sic)''\"\n#\"We invited a soldier into our home when he was traveling, and he repaid our hospitality by stealing from us! Kill that ungracious bastard.\"",

Kassandra infiltrated the first camp, finding [[wolves]] held in cages.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These wolves will want blood once released. I should be careful.''\nAfter eliminating the guards, Kassandra released the wolves one by one.\n[[File:ACOD Caged and Enraged 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra discovering Zoe's companions in cages]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Easy, four-legs.

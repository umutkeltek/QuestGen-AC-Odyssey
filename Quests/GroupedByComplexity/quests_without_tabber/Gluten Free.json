    "Section_Description": "Kassandra went to look for [[Lagos]]' family after learning they had been kidnapped by the [[Cult of Kosmos]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra infiltrated the nondescript cave under the farm and slew the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]] guards within. In the depths of the cave, she found a woman and child, [[Philonoe]] and [[Niloxenos]], locked in cages. She released and spoke to them as the two tearfully embraced.

Then one day, those guards dragged us here.''\n(Leave - \"I'll deal with the scary men.\")<br>\n[[File:ACOD Gluten Free 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra speaking to Niloxenos]]\nKassandra knelt down and smiled at Niloxenos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're making your ''pater'' do things he doesn't want to do.''\nShe stood and turned to Philonoe, while still addressing the child.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find Lagos and release him from these scary men.''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''And what of us? I can't go back to that wretch, and now that these guards are dead, we're in danger.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For now, go to my friend, Brasidas. He'll meet you at the safe house northeast of Tegea.''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''Where Lagos has his secret meetings...''\nShe remained skeptical of the whole turn of events.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra rescued Lagos' family and removed the Cult's leverage over him. This gave him the option to abandon the Cult altogether.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Completing this quest reduces Lagos' persistent bounty, presumably as a result of him learning Kassandra rescued his family, but maintaining it just enough to placate the Cult.  Together with [[Breaking Bread]] and [[Fourth-Degree Burns]], this can remove up to two of the three helmets before dealing with Lagos and lifting the bounty altogether.",

You got it, didn't you? I can smell Adamantine, and you smell good!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here. Don't tell me you need more, because I've run out of necks to cut it from.''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''There's real passion behind your words, I can feel it. I'm personally glad to say that these will do. The blood on them is a nice touch, by the way. Helps with the quenching.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do what I can.''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''Wait here. This won't take long.''",

Do you have the time to accompany me and Achaikos to our triumphant performance?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''After all this, I wouldn't miss it.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Excellent, we team up once more.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So we're a team now? Can I still expect to get paid?''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''After my performance, [[drachma]]e will be in no short supply, trust me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've dedicated your life to your art. You must have a lot to show for it.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''I write a hundred poems every night when I go to sleep and throw out a hundred every morning when I wake up. Luckily some have survived to touch people.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you have any favorites?''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''There's one I'm well known for that is very dear to me. The most beautiful thing I leave is the light of the [[sun]]. Second are the shining stars and the face of the [[moon]]. Then ripe cucumbers, apples, and pears too.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds nice. But we should get going.''\nKassandra began escorting Praxilla.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, cucumbers?''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''The sun gives us the fruit of the trees like the fruit of the loins.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''In your poem, you say you leave the sun. Why?''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Not me. [[Adonis]]. He is being asked upon death about the most beautiful things he's left behind. To me, there is no greater beauty than that of the sun and the moon and stars.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh! Why is he being asked this?''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Adonis is beauty incarnate. What could be so beautiful that even he would be pained to leave?''\nThey reached a small stage outside the [[Port of Kreusis]], where a crowd was gathering.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see. Looks like we made it.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Marvelous, thank you! Looks like my adoring fans are ready for me. Be sure to catch the show.''\nKassandra walked up the stage alongside Praxilla, watching the crowd. [[Alkibiades]] was among the individuals in attendance.\n*'''[[Phaenna]]:''' ''It's Praxilla!''\n*'''[[Laches]]:''' ''I heard she was coming this year!''\n*'''[[Krantor]]:''' ''Praxilla! Recite something for us.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''I've been reciting this poem for years. Kassandra, would you do me the kindness of allowing me to hear it anew from your lips?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I couldn't.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Nonsense, you know everything you need to do it justice. How about something new this year?''\nKassandra recited the poem.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The most beautiful thing I leave is the light of the sun.''\n*'''Krantor:''' ''Praise be [[Apollo]]!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Second are the shining stars and the face of the moon.''\n*'''Laches:''' ''This is one of my favorites.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then ripe cucumbers, apples, and pears too.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''That's always been my favorite verse.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''I'm happy my poem touched you so deeply, Kassandra. Have you thought about trading your [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]] for the lyre?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will stick to swinging [[sword]]s, thanks.''\nThey later heard a commotion and realized a group of [[bandit]]s were attempting to disrupt the festival.\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''It wouldn't be a poetry festival without someone causing a disturbance.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Praxilla! Get to safety. I can handle them.''\nKassandra joined some of the [[civilian]]s and fought off the bandits, then returned to Praxilla.\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Happens every year. Some cursed idiots drink too much [[wine]] and get themselves killed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't know poetry festivals were such lively events.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Indeed. I need to take a moment to recover. Let's go back to my tent.''\nKassandra followed Praxilla to her tent, where they found [[Alkibiades]] and [[Orchimedes]].\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Ah, but we do have a happy ending!''\n*'''Orchimedes:''' ''Praxilla, it has taken me long years of soul searching and many nights of tears to bring myself to this moment. I am Orchimedes, your son.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''When I heard the name of the man who stole my lyre, I suspected it might be you.''\nOrchimedes held Praxilla's hands.\n*'''Orchimedes:''' ''I've dreamt of hurting you as you hurt me and my [[Achaikos|father]] a thousand times. But I only knew you as the mother who abandoned me, and not as the artist I just saw.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Just as Adonis lamented the beauty he left behind, I too left that which was most precious to me on the death of my old self.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not dead. Neither of you are. Take this opportunity and see what you can build together.''\n*'''Praxilla:''' ''Thank you for all your help.''",

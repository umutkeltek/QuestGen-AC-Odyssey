She looted valuables scattered nearby, finding the key to the chest. She unlocked the chest, acquiring a wax tablet, a stele, and a pair of [[Rusty Mycenaean Gauntlets|gauntlets]].

We need to find the other stele pieces. Are you ready?''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll go look.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If we found these, then we'll find the other stele pieces too.

Until I read this part...''\nEppie pointed to another section of the writings.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's more?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''It mentions that the ritual will be activated.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What ritual?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I have no idea.

So digging through dirt and cobwebbed words is your ambition?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''My role is to breathe life into the ancients.''\n(If players choose \"What about your peers?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do any of your peers support you in this?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''None.

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra reclined on a rooftop couch in the evening as she ate grapes, drank [[wine]], and hummed contentedly. Tossing another grape in her mouth, she made to drink from her cup only to be disappointed on finding it empty. Turning to sit and pour another cup from an amphorae, she overheard [[Herodotos]] and [[Barnabas]] bickering as they approached from below.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''If she's not here, Barnabas, we may as well give up.''\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm on vacation!''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Ah, you've been in the [[sun]] too long! You're more [[bronze]] than an urn! Come down here!''\nKassandra waved her hand dismissively.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pah, nonsense!''\nKassandra sat back down with her back against the balcony.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''What if I told you, uh... a mythical treasure awaits! Ah? What say you then?''\nKassandra laughed lightly<br>...\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Only the most exciting thing to happen to you in ages!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've had enough excitement for a lifetime.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''This was the last place we thought to look for you on [[Korfu]]. What have you been doing all on your own?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing, dear Herodotos. And I've had the time of my life!''\nBarnabas and Herodotos looked at each other, concerned over Kassandra's apparent change from her usual mood. Kassandra grabbed another cup and walked toward a balcony overlooking a cliffside.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Napping in the day, star-gazing at night, and as much wine as I can swallow.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''That's quite unlike you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The old Kassandra, maybe. But the new Kassandra has never felt better.''\nThe three arrived on the balcony, which had a carpets laid out beside a table set with another amphorae of wine. Kassandra stared at the amphorae while Barnabas voiced his shock at her change in life plans.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Not retiring, are you?''\n...\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You just need a little distraction from the weight. Say you'll do it. Come on the hunt!''\nKassandra stared off distantly, lost in thought.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''For the ''[[Adrestia]]''. For me?''\nUnable to turn down her friend's personal request, Kassandra relented.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Alright, we'll hunt for treasure. To put some [[drachma]]e in your pocket.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''That's our ''[[mercenary|misthios]]''!''\nHe laughed in his excitement.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Oh, the loot will be enough for a whole new [[ship]]!''\nHe cleared his throat, attempting to gain a more serious tone.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Legends say there are delicate linens woven by [[Greek mythology|goddesses]], ancient scrolls, one-of-a-kind wares from a far-off land!''\nHerodotos shook his head and laughed as Barnabas' exhuberence.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Let's not get too carried away, Barnabas.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Oh, right. I won't spoil any surprises.''\nHe turned back to Kassandra.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You'll find clues around the island that will lead to treasures beyond imagnination.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it's so legendary, I'm surprised no one's found it yet.''\nBarnabas spread his arms wide.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''They've tried for hundreds of years\u2014!''\nHe stopped on seeing Herodotos' pointed stare.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''...well, less than that, but no one has discovered it. Not until we do today!''\nKassandra sighed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll see. The only thing this island has a lot of is sand. And [[Piracy|pirates]].''\nKassandra turned around and walked back into the house.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go get my gear.''",

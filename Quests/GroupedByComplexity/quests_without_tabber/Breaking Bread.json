    "General_Description": "'''Breaking Bread''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "[[Myrrine]] tasked Kassandra with eliminating [[Lagos]]' men.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to the camp.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the camp. Time to send some guards to [[Hades]].''\nKassandra made her way to the [[Fort of Arkas]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The fort at last. Should find a quiet way in.''\nKassandra made her way to the [[Tegea Barracks]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ah. These must be the barracks ''[[Myrrine|mater]]'' spoke of.''\nDepending on the order she cleared the locations, Kassandra remarked on her progress.<br />\n(If the camp is cleared first.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The camp is clear. I still have to find the barracks and the fort. The fort is also in Smuggler's Forest\u2014I should start there.''\n(If the fort is cleared next.)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''Now that the fort and camp have been cleared, I should head to the barracks.''\n(If the barracks are cleared next.)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''That takes care of the barracks and the camp. Now I need to clear the fort.''\n(If the barracks are cleared first.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The barracks are clear. But Lagos still has guards at the camp and the fort. Both are in Smuggler's Forest.''\n(If the camp is cleared next.)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''That takes care of the camp and the barracks. My last target [is] the fort, which is also in Smuggler's Forest.''\n(If the fort is cleared next.)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''That takes care of the fort and the barracks. Time to deal with Lagos's guards at the camp.''\n(If the fort is cleared first.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The camp should be nearby, I'll head there first. Then on to the barracks.''\n(If the camp is cleared next.)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''Two strongholds down. Now I just need to find these barracks'' mater ''spoke of. She said they were in [[Tegea]].''\n(If the barracks are cleared next.)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''The barracks and the fort are clear. Time to find the camp.''\n(After all three locations are cleared.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mater'' said [[Lagos]] is hiding in [[Fort Samikon]]. Time to go pay him a little visit.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra crippled Lagos' forces by striking at them in their most critical assembly areas.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Completing the quest reduces Lagos' persistent bounty, as the quest sends his forces scrambling. Together with [[Gluten Free]] and [[Fourth-Degree Burns]], this can remove up to two of the three helmets before dealing with Lagos and lifting the bounty altogether.\n*The quest's name is contradictory to the metaphor of the same name, as the latter pertains to making peace or compromise with an enemy.",

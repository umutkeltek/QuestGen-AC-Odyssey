Watching, waiting...''\n(If \"Who's out there?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who's after you?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''The [[Cult of Kosmos]]. Remember [[Athens]]? They never stopped hunting me, Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would they be after you now?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''They want me dead. Moving me here has only bought a little more time.

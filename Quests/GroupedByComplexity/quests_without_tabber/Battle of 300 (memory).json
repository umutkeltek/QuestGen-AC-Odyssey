Every drop of blood, sweat and tear, all of it, has led to where you stand right now. The Persians come to make slaves of us all. I have a better idea. I say we drench the gods with their blood. What say you Spartans?''\nThe Spartans roared.\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''For our sons!''\nThe Spartans roared again.\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''For our daughters!''\nThe Spartans roared again.\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''For Sparta!''\n[[File:ACOD Kurush Spartan Soldiers.png|thumb|250px|Kurush fighting two Spartans]]\nThe Spartans roared three times, then mounted guard for the incoming Persian attack.

The two men threw themselves off a cliff, and stood up.\n*'''Kurush:''' ''Puny Spartan! I'll bring [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] your head.''\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''Xerxes send his sheep to slaughter. Come, Persian!''\n*'''Kurush:''' ''I will bring Xerxes your head, you insolent Spartan fool!''\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''Come and get it!''\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''My ''son'' is more of a warrior than you.''\n*'''Kurush:''' ''Once I'm done with you, king, all of Sparta's sons will be slaves for Xerxes!''\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''Sparta's sons would rather die!''\n*'''Kurush:''' ''That can be arranged.''\nLeonidas killed Kurush.\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''No match for a Spartan!''\nAt the end of the battle, the Spartan were piling up the bodies of the Persians. A Spartan soldier brought a Persian soldier tied to Leonidas.\n*'''Spartan Light Soldier:''' ''We are betrayed, my king. Xerxes knows of [[Cave of Kratos|the path]] behind the mountain. They are coming.''\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''By dawn, you'll be completely surrounded!''\n*'''Leonidas:''' ''We are Spartans, when we are not.''\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''Spartans!''\nThe Persian spat on Leonidas.\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''That word will mean nothing when Xerxes wipes your bloodline from the face of th\u2014''\n\nLeonidas stabbed the Persian on the mouth, killing him.

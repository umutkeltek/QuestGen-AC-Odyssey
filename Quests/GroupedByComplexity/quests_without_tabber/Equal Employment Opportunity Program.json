The seas are more dangerous now that [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]] are at each other's throats.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We need new recruits to better our crew...''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I know where to start - the best archer I know, he'd be a valuable asset.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When can we meet him?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Well... You're going to have to ''persuade'' him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You get him aboard, and I'll talk him into it... A little drachmae should sweeten the deal.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, you want me to... knock him out.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''No, no. Well, maybe just pacify him a little. Then get him to the ship, so we can have a little talk. Everything will be fine, I promise you.''\n[[File:ACOD Equal Employment Opportunity Program 2.png|thumb|250px|The ''Adrestia'' docked near the bandit camp]]\nAs the ''[[Adrestia]]'' approached the [[Marooned Bandit Camp]], [[Barnabas]] was in a cheerful mood.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''The gods are with us today, Kassandra. The sea is calm, and the winds are warm.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's beautiful.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''It is, my friend. It sure is. That's the island. You'll need to be cautious - it'll be crawling with pirates.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should send [[Ikaros]] up to get the lay of the land. He'll spot my target.''\n[[File:ACOD Equal Employment Opportunity Program 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra recruiting Phemios]]\nWith Ikaros having spotted the archer, Kassandra dove into the waters to swim to the island. She crept to the platform [[Phemios]] stood on, incapacitating him, then making an offer for him to join the crew.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'll make a worthy addition to the crew.''\n(At this point, players can continue to recruit any soldier on the island.)<br>\nKassandra returned to the boat.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I got him.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Good, he'll be a valuable asset to the crew.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Will he be enough?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Don't worry, there'll be plenty of opportunities to recruit more people as we go.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Something tells me we're going to need them.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''We should set a course for [[Megaris]]. A long voyage can be relaxing, but we are not really the cruising type. If you want to spice things up a bit, you can always check my log over there. I make a note of anything I hear that could be of interest... to a daring captain.''",

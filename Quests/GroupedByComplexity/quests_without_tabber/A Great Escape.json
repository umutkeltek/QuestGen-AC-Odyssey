    "Section_Description": "Tired after so many years fighting and starting to realize the full burden of the task [[Aletheia]] had given her as immortal Keeper of the [[Staff of Hermes Trismegistus|Staff]] of [[Hermes Trismegistus]], Kassandra returned to [[Kephallonia]] hoping to quietly retreat from society.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "While passing through [[Sami]]'s port, Kassandra saw a woman calling out to [[Civilian|passersby]] from where she stood on the quay by a docked [[ship]].\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''Come sail away! Find your bliss on [[Korfu]]! [[Boat]]s leaving daily!''\nInterested, Kassandra walked up and spoke to the cruise barker.\n[[File:ACOD A Great Escape 2.png|thumb|250px|The cruise barker pitching the island of Korfu as a vacation destination]]\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''Care to visit paradise, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Paradise? Does the boat go to [[Elysium]]?''\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''To Korfu Island! A land with no work and all play. A vacation destination.''\nKassandra shook her head.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Vacation? What's that?''\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''A state of mind. Where your only responsibility is to get much-needed rest. It's a new concept.''\nKassandra smiled at the thought of finally relaxing.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It does sound tempting.''\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''There are no clearer waters than off the coast of Korfu...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How about [[soldier]]s? Criminals? ''People''. That's who I ''really'' need a break from.''\nThe sales woman laughed.\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''If there are, they're too busy relaxing. Can I interest you in today's passage?''\n(\"I'll take the vacation\")<br>Kassandra put her hand to her chin in thought.\n[[File:ACOD A Great Escape 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra departing for Korfu for a vacation]]\n*'''Kasssandra:''' ''It's just what I need. Vacation. For a couple of days, at least.''\n*'''Cruise Barker:''' ''Then step aboard. Your next destination: bliss.''\nKassandra followed the cruise barker as she walked to the docking ramp and boarded the ship.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra decided to take some time for herself and relax on the relatively secluded island of Korfu.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "This memory is only accessable after players have completed \"[[The Big Break]]\" and reached [[Megaris]], afterwhich they can find the quest giver back at Sami's port on Kephallonia. Since the memory arc references events from the end of ''Odyssey''{{'}}s main plot as well as both its expansions ''[[Legacy of the First Blade]]'' and ''[[The Fate of Atlantis]]'', it is strongly suggested that new players not start this sequence until after completing the game in its entirety.",

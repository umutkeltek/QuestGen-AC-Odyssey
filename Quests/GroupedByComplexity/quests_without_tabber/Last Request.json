It seems our fleet is under attack, and I need to redirect the troops to help. I will ask you to take on the Spartan command again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Polemarch|commanders]] will be taken care of.''\n(If players choose \"Why is Athens at war?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You seem to admire art and philosophy... But how can someone who truly values that go to [[Peloponnesian War|war]]?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''If you have any care for knowledge or the arts, you must be ready to defend these rights. I am here to take up arms so that they can continue to enrich our culture. As long as they are threatened, battle must be fought.''\n(If players choose \"Why does a general support democracy?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You expect total obedience from your soldiers, I suppose. So why do you fight for [[democracy]]?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''What is free will? It's essential that citizens play an active role in the function of their state.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But Athens recognizes only ''select'' citizens. Spartans recognize merit. In Sparta, a [[Helot|slave]] can rise.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Spartan rule would mean the demise of democracy.''\n(Leave - \"I'll leave now.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll leave now.''\nKassandra returns to Demosthenes with the seals.\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Perhaps [[Athena]] was smiling down upon Athens when she sent you to me. You've far surpassed my expectations.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I always aim to do a good job.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''You have. Beyond that, you've shown an understanding of war and its price. That's a lesson some never learn. This General [[Lysander]], you know him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What Spartan doesn't?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''If he's as good as he seems, then I'm even more grateful for your help. I respect his reputation, if not the man.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''War changes the rules for us all.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''So it does. Thank you, [[Ikaros|Eagle]] Bearer. I'm sure we'll meet again.''",

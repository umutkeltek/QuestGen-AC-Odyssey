    "General_Description": "'''Call to Arms''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Call came to free the [[Silver Islands]] from the yoke of overthrow the [[Athens|Athenian]] forces, and Kassandra was there to answer it.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached [[Herodianos]] at the Spartan camp on the beach.\n*'''Herodianos:''' ''Eagle Bearer! My name is Herodianos, second to [[Thaletas]] in battle. The dogs of war howl for blood, and thanks to you, Sparta now howls back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like a lot of howling.''\n(If extra ships were sunk during [[The Thaletas Way]])\n*'''Herodianos:''' ''And thanks to your victory against the Athenian fleet at sea, their best troops are at the bottom of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. The day is as good as ours! Join us.''\n(else)\n*'''Herodianos:''' ''Fight with us. Together, we'll run our shields through their skulls, and spears through their hearts.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll fight for Sparta.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd be honored to fight with Sparta.''\n*'''Herodianos:''' ''To battle!''\n[[File:ACOd-Dioklesbattle.jpg|thumb|250px|Diokles in battle]]\nKassandra fought alongside the Spartans on the [[Battleground of Silver Islands|beach]].  During the battle, [[Diokles (Athenian Soldier)|Diokles]] appeared on the battlefield and challenged Kassandra. She defeated him and claimed a [[Cult of Kosmos notes|letter]] that confirmed what she already knew; that [[Podarkes]] was a member of the [[Cult of Kosmos]]. The Spartans eventually overwhelmed the Athenian forces, driving them from power on the Delos Islands.",
    "Section_Outcome": "With Kassandra's help, the Spartan forces overwhelmed the Athenian support and took control of the islands, removing Podarkes' regime from leadership.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*This quest yields the Cultist clue that formally unveils Podarkes as a member of the Cult of Kosmos, even though that has been known for some time.  If Podarkes is slain prior to this quest, this clue cannot be read.\n**Under certain circumstances, simply reloading the game will add the clue to Podarkes' submenu, even if he is already dead.\n*If any of the [[Ambition|quests]] for [[Lysander]] are active, killing Diokles counts as killing an ordinary Athenian ''[[polemarch]]'' and yields one of the seals.\n*Completing this memory will also complete the [[Bleeding Hearts and Stolen Money]], which part of [[Kyra]]'s storyline.",

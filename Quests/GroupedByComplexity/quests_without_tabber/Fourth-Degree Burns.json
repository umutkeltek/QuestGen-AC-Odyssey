    "Section_Description": "Kassandra was tasked with with destroying [[Lagos]]' grain supplies.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to [[Lagos' Compound]] in the shadow of [[Mount Psophis]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These must be the silos. There's enough grain in here to feed hundreds of hungry soldiers.''\nShe drew close and inspected the silos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That hatch on top looks like it'll burn, and the wheat will catch fire.''\nKassandra infiltrated the camp and positioned herself best to set the first silo alight. It exploded in a burst of burning wheat.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good, now two more left to burn.''\nShe set fire to the second silo.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Only one left.''\nShe destroyed the final silo.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That settles it. Without grain, [[Lagos]] won't be able to feed his troops\u2014or pay for more.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra set fire to Lagos' grain stockpile, crippling his ability to fund and feed an army.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Completing the quest reduces Lagos' persistent bounty, as the quest chips away at his ability to fund it. Together with [[Gluten Free]] and [[Breaking Bread]], this can remove up to two of the three helmets before dealing with Lagos and lifting the bounty altogether.",

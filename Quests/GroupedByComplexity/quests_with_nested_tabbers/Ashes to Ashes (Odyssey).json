Chrysis will find a lot more than a helpless infant waiting for her.''\nOn top of the altar laid a dead [[eagle]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A warning.

Rushing to the nearby shrine, Kassandra was attacked by Cultist guards.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All you [[Cult of Kosmos|Cultists]] will die here!''\n[[File:ACOD_Ashes_to_Ashes_-_Chrysis_Kassandra.png|thumb|250px|Chrysis confronted by Kassandra]]\nOnce the cultists were dealt with, she entered the shrine, finding Chrysis cradling a swaddled [[Alethea|baby]].\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''Killing seems to run in your bloodline, oh mighty Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't you dare speak of my family, snake.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''I still remember the night your [[Myrrine|mother]] brought me [[Alexios|my child]]. The sad, pathetic thing, crying in the rain. Had I known then that Myrrine had ''two'' children... but, here you are. My family is complete.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|If Neighbour killed during Dolops Quest=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You take children from their mothers and silence anyone who gets in your way.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''If you're referring to [[Mydon]], it was he who chose to slice off his cursed tongue.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm talking about the [[Dolops|farmer]] you had killed in [[Epidauros]].''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''I should have killed that idiot son of mine years ago.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your own son!''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''Dolops turned his back on me the night I rescued your brother.

They're dead, by the way.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''Dolops ceased being my son when he turned his back on the gods.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean turned his back on you.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''The baby was destined to be mine! He was too stupid to understand that.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You let my mother believe her baby was dead.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''But he was. Oh, how she wept when his little heart stopped beating. But then ''I'' took care of him. Placed him on this very altar. Screamed for the gods to spare his life.

I can be a mother to you, too, Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This goes beyond my family. You and your Cult are going to destroy the [[Greece|Greek]] world. You bring nothing but suffering.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''You talk of suffering and yet you come drenched in blood and threaten my life. You are a killer, just like your brother. Here, let me show you.''\nChrysis hurled an explosive at the altar, and the room erupted in flames. She made her escape, leaving Kassandra with the crying infant.\n|-|What happened to my brother?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did you do with my brother?''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''I saved his life. By teaching him to suffer. To know pain so well that he would learn to welcome it like an old friend. And now, he will teach all of the Greek world to know that pain.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You... tortured him! He was just a baby.''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''I taught him to survive! This world is cruel. It demands strength, or death. So I gave him strength.''\n|-|Where is my mother?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where did my mother go that night?''\n*'''Chrysis:''' ''That weakling crawled to the hills of [[Korinth]]. [[The Monger]] was supposed to deliver her back to me. But she can't hide forever.

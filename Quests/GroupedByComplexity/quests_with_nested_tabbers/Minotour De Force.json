Lots of blood! Think of the fame, ''misthios''! Think of winning the ''Prize of Pephka!\nLeiandros leaned forward, whispering to Kassandra.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Please trust me, champion\u2014nothing is what it seems in Pepha. Solving one problem may just solve all the others...''\nLeiandros stepped backwards and raised his voice again.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Go, my legendary friend! The Pre-Trials of the Minotaur await!''\nKassandra departed to complete the trials mentioned by Leiandros. In doing so, she collected all the three tokens to prove her success.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all 3 Tokens. Better [[Cashing In On the Cow|meet]] Leiandros at the [[Warrior's Rest]].''",

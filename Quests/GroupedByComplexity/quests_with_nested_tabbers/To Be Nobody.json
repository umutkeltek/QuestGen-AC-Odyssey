Careful\u2014my vision showed a horrible [[cyclops]] lurking in the darkness.''\nKassandra explored the island, finding the cave of [[Drakontospilo]].

You Little.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sure, \"Little.\" Polyphemos, I'm looking for a woman who was here.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''No friend for long time. You help make friend. Friend fish together.

Never again!''\nAfter she dealt with the lynxes, they continued towards the shore.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little think Polyphemos cyclops?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're nothing like the [[Cyclops of Kephallonia|Cyclops]] from [[Kephallonia]]. He had one real eye and one [[Obsidian Eye|fake eye]]. He picked on Little.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Pick on Little! What you do?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I [[The Big Break|shoved]] his fake eye up a [[goat]]'s ass.''\nThe large man laughed at that.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little funny.''\nThey reached the remains of the village near the shore. Polyphemos hid again.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Bad men! Hate Polyphemos!''\nIn the ruins, a group of [[bandit]]s had made their camp. To put Polyphemos' mind at ease, Kassandra dealt with the bandits. The way to the shore was finally clear.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There, big guy. The beach is yours now, to fish all you want.''\nPolyphemos smiled brightly, and sat down on the rocks, enjoying the view for a moment.

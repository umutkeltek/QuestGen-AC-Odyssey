I was happy to get your message.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I'm happy it got to you in time.''\n[[File:ACOD We Will Rise 3.png|thumb|250px|Brasidas and Kassandra discussing Pylos and Kleon]]\n(If players asked \"What happened to you after Pylos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me what happened after the battle.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''They found me wounded. I was taken back to [[Sparta]] and given time to heal. My leg won't be the same, but they didn't kill me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No Spartan got off easy. I was captured and brought to [[Athens]].''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Athens? That rubs salt into the wound.

We need to move.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Easy. First, we need to ''find'' him. We're outnumbered, and our spies say he's already sent for Athenian reinforcements.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All the more reason to act.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You've proven yourself. It's a risk, but I trust you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We're going to stop Kleon. I give you my word.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Good.

We have bigger problems right now.''\n(If players asked \"What happened to you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''After Pylos\u2014what happened?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''The remaining Spartans found me and gave me time to recover, so I did.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But your leg\u2014''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You disappeared from battle.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was captured\u2014taken to [[Athens]] for an interrogation with [[Deimos]] and [[Kleon]].''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''They didn't kill you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They tried.''\n(If players asked \"Where's Kleon?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So Kleon's in Amphipolis...''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Somewhere. And in armor, I hear. He'll fight for his life today.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He wants to be the hero.

We kill Kleon today.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''If you don't, then I will.''\nBrasidas crossed his arms, refusing to look at her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's something you're not telling me.''\nBrasidas snorted.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I am here for Kleon. Let's keep it at that.''\nHe walked away from Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought we were friends.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You're not who I thought you were.

Let's go.''\nBrasidas walked away from Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' M\u00e1laka.\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD We Will Rise 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra following Brasidas and his men to the battlefield]]\nBrasidas led his men towards the [[Battleground of Makedonia|battlefield]] as Kassandra followed at his side.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Today, we give everything we have.<br>No giving up!''\nOn the way to the battlefield, they were ambushed by Athenians who had reached the scaffolding of the city.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''The Athenians are here! Spartans, charge!''\nArchers took up high positions.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Archers on the wall!<br>They need to be shot down! Now!''\nThe Spartans defeated the Athenian ambushers, then made their way down the road to their main camp.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''The Athenian camp is ahead. Destroy it all!''\nBrasidas and Kassandra joined the Spartan fight against the Athenians. \n\nIn a repeat of the [[Battle of Pylos]], Kassandra defeated several Athenian soldiers, then watched [[Deimos]] enter the fray, slaying everyone in his path as he made his way towards Brasidas.\n*'''Deimos:''' ''You want war?!''\n[[File:ACOD We Will Rise 9.png|thumb|250px|Brasidas killed by Deimos]]\nBrasidas and Deimos fought once again, the latter eventually getting the upper hand as Brasidas' defences failed after one another, and finally Deimos impaled Brasidas upon his own spear. Kassandra, who had witnessed it all, lunged at Deimos, pouncing on him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Arrrrggghhh!''\nKassandra and Deimos locked spear and sword, neither giving way.\n*'''Deimos:''' ''You take everything so personally!''\n[[File:ACOD We Will Rise 13.png|thumb|250px|Kleon panicking]]\nAs he mocked Kassandra, Deimos suddenly gasped in surprise, having been struck by an arrow. He fell to the ground and Kassandra looked up. At the edge of the battlefield, astounded Kleon dropped his bow, having apparently missed his target. When their eyes met, Kleon panicked and ran.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''Shit!''\nKassandra pursued him.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''Turn back! Don't come any closer!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fucking coward! He can't get away.''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''Stop! I beg you!''\n[[File:ACOD We Will Rise 14.png|thumb|250px|Kleon trying to reason with Kassandra]]\nKassandra chased Kleon to the beach, where he made his last stand.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''This isn't your fight, Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Unfortunately for you, it is.''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''It's not too late, you know. You can still join us.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We're not in Athens. You can't talk your way out of this.''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''Why won't you just leave me alone? This is all your fault.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You did this, Kleon. You have only yourself to blame.''\nKassandra inflicted some deep wounds on Kleon.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''You've only ever been a nuisance to us.''\nKassandra eventually subdued Kleon utterly, tossing him into the sand near the water. She cracked her knuckles as she approached him menacingly.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''Kassandra, come now! Show mercy!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You turned him against us. My own brother.''\nKleon backed away.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''We lifted Deimos up. We made him ''great''! Unstoppable!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You made him a monster.''\nKassandra backhanded Kleon.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''Then fight by his side\u2014teach him! You would have Deimos once again.''\nKassandra grabbed Kleon by the throat.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''His name is Alexios.''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''I beg you! This world is severed, Kassandra, and we'll ''unite'' it!''\nKassandra tossed Kleon away from her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shut the fuck up.''\nKleon held up his hands in front of him as he cowered.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''My hands are empty\u2014have ''pity''!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Kill \u2013 I'll kill you mercifully.=\n[[File:ACOD We Will Rise 15.png|thumb|250px|Kleon's neck being snapped by Kassandra]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't deserve a quick death. But you'll earn what you meet at the [[Underworld|gates]] of [[Hades]].''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''No.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now kneel.''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''You don't understand. No one will forget me, Kleon of Athens. I will be remembered u\u2014''\nKassandra grabbed Kleon and snapped his neck, dropping his lifeless body into the ocean.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're already forgotten.''\nKassandra stepped back from what she had done.\n|-|Kill \u2013 I'm going you kill you slowly.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You will die just as you lived.<br>As a coward.''\nKassandra grabbed Kleon's arm and turned him around on his knees.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''I'm not through, I won't be forgotten\u2014for all I've done.''\nKassandra kicked him in the back into the water and pressed his face into the shallow, muddied sea water with her foot. She allowed him up for air twice, Kleon struggling to draw breath each time.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not worth the memory.''\nShe resumed until he finally drowned.\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's it, then. [[Myrrine]] will want to know Kleon is dead.<br>...And Brasidas. I should have gotten to Deimos sooner. I'm sorry, my friend.''",

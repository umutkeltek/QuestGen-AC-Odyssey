But I need you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm no\u00a0actor or poet, Aristophanes.''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''By the gods, no! it's Thespis. My leading man is missing!

He wouldn't let me down... Something must be wrong!''\n(If players asked \"Why is Thespis special?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You could just get another actor.''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''Oh, no. Thespis always draws a huge crowd for his performances.<br />The more people who experience my blistering indictment of Kleon, the better.''\n(If players chose \"Tell me where you think Thespis is.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where would I find him?''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''Thespis usually doesn't go far from his home. You'd best start there.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll fetch Thespis.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This shouldn't take long. Prepare the show, and I'll be back as soon as I find him.''\nKassandra travelled to the [[Agora of Athens]]. [[Ikaros]] helped her identify the actor's house.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be Thespis' house.''\nShe approached the house but only found an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Bulis|soldier]]. She overheard him as he rifled through Thespis' belongings.\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Come on, come on. It's got to be here!''\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra interrogating Bulis]]\nKassandra stepped inside, quickly disarmed the soldier, and held him at spearpoint.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't look like an actor, unless you're playing an Athenian [[guard]].''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''I\u2014I...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hush. I'm going to ask some questions, and you're going to answer.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''But Commander [[Rhexenor]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's your name?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Bulis.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well Bulis, it's your choice whether you walk out of here. Do you understand?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Yes.''\n(If players asked \"What are you doing?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me, what are you looking for?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Some stupid play. They don't tell me anything.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Play?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''I just do what I'm told, and they told me to destroy the manuscript.''\n(If players asked \"Where's Thespis?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What have you done with Thespis?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Some of the boys are meant to keep him drunk in the [[Tavern, Athens|tavern]] down the street.''\n(If players chose \"You must know more.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'd better be telling me everything.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''All I know is they wanted to keep this actor busy. See for yourself\u2014he's at the tavern.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're sure that's all?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''I just follow the Commander's orders.

You're loyal, and you follow orders.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''You'd take me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you say?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''To get away from Athens... Thank you, thank you.''\nBulis promptly left and later joined the crew of the ''[[Adrestia]].''\n|-|Don't let me see you again.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get out of here, and count yourself lucky.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Thank you, thank you...''\nBulis ran off.\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra travelled to the tavern, finding a drunk Thespis surrounded by a group of Athenian guards.\n*'''Thespis:''' ''...And then I saids to him, if this is your wife, why did she charge me?!<br />I'd loves to stay, but my cup's drained, and I'm to perform tomorrow.''\nThe [[Andras|brute]] leading the soldiers bid him to stay, as per his orders.\n*'''Andras:''' ''Another drink! Come, one more tale. The night is young...''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think he's had enough.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''And what business is it of yours, ''friend''?''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Yeah, was business... Oh, look at you!''\n*'''Andras:''' ''You'd best be leaving.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Not without Thespis.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here for his employer, Aristophanes.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''So? He's not working now.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Yes! I's not working... I like him though. Aristophanes, funny man... buts opinions. Told him it's dangerous.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''That it is.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need him sober and rested.''\n|-|I don't want any trouble.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm just here for Thespis. He's drunk, and I need to get him home.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''What are you, his mater?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's say extended family.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me Memory 6.png|thumb|250px|Soldiers gathering behind Andras]]\nAthenian soldiers gathered behind Andras.\n*'''Andras:''' ''I don't think you understand the situation.

I'm sure they miss you.''\nAndras and his guards began to walk away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''(Maaa!)''\nAndras snapped and turned back to attack Kassandra with his guards. She slew them and returned her attention to Thespis.\n|-|Get out of here!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you don't want to leave with your heads stuffed up your asses, you'll go now.''\nAndras stood up.\n*'''Andras:''' ''We'll be seeing you, misthios.

You deserve better than to live under the threat of the Cult.''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''You sound like Brasidas when he was your age. You give me hope.''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''The Cult gave me [[Spartan War Hero Belt|this]]. They said it was a sign of my devotion. Maybe you can use it against them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure I can find a way.''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''I'll lift the bounty on you and Myrrine. And may you find success in your fight against this evil.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you, Archon. We appreciate it.''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''You saved my family from the Cult by yourself... You're courageous.''\nKassandra was perturbed by this remark.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why?''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''You've made an enemy of a king. [[Pausanias]] threatened my family with torture and death if I betrayed him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pausanias?! Do you have proof?''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''Here\u2014evidence of his treachery.''\n[[File:ACOD Judge, Jury, Executioner 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra given Pausanias' ring]]\nKassandra looked at the evidence and nodded.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you. I'll see about this king of lies.''\nShe took her leave of her new ally, and he smiled warmly at her conviction.\n\n(If the Monger was killed publicly)\n*'''Lagos:''' ''You expect me to trust you?

I won't bow my head just for you to cut it off.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That wasn't my plan.''\n*'''Lagos:''' ''Then I should thank you for letting me face death as Spartans do.''\nIn spite of her efforts to resolve things peacefully, Lagos decided not to trust Kassandra.

Any outstanding [[Cult of Kosmos notes|Cultist clues]] from this branch will not be readable in his Cultist submenu if they are obtained after this point.\n**Given that two are obtained in the main story prior to this point, the only clues the player could be missing are from [[Skylax]] and [[Kallias]], the latter of whom is encountered during the [[Olympic Games]] line of memories but not necessarily killed in the course thereof. A fifth can be obtained by dueling [[Stentor]], but this locks the player out of the game's best ending.",

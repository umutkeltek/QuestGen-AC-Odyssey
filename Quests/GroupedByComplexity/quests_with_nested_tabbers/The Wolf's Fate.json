How was Megaris?''\nKassandra slammed [[The Wolf's Helm|Nikolaos' helmet]] on the table.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Wolf is dead.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Excellent. The full amount, as promised. You expected me to haggle? Come now, Kassandra. It isn't every day I have someone kill their own father.

Oh, why him? Because he was brilliant. He would have taken [[Athens]] in a month, two at most. And [[Stentor]] doesn't have the Wolf's genius.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You wanted to save Athens?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''There's no profit in a quick war.''\nKassandra stared at Elpenor in disbelief.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I know, I know. It's a lot to take in all at once. Come.''\nThe pair walked outside the building.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Tell me, ''misthios'', did you learn anything worthwhile in your dealings with the Wolf?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nMy birth father might live.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He mentioned [[Pythagoras|my birth father]], he might still be alive.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Not for long, if all goes according to plan.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''You're going to bring me his head, of course.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you lost your mind?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''You killed the man who raised you for [[drachma]]e.

All of the arts, really. A great general throws his own children off a [[Mount Taygetos|cliff]] on the say-so of the [[Pythia|Oracle]]... It is a tragedy for the ages.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You think my life is entertainment?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Oh no, my friend. It is art. I know, I know. It's a lot to take in all at once.

His guards grabbed her and dragged her out of the house, throwing her onto the yard.\n</tabber>\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''So disappointing.''\nElpenor left and fled the area. Kassandra fought and killed the guards.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor snuck away like a coward. I should investigate his house.''\nShe began to search his house.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A letter to Elpenor.''\n:'''Elpenor's Note''' ''[[Krethos]]: You were right about the [[Kephallonia]]n [[Phoibe|peasant girl]]. She led me right to the ''misthios''. Near the [[Ancient Ruins of Kranioi|ancient ruins of Kranioi]]. You did good work tracking them down. Now, to get them both to trust me... Did I ever tell you I was a fan of theater? As for you, find your payment in Phokis. Signed, Elpenor.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh Phoibe, you led him right to me.''\nOn another table she located a papyrus scroll.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor's looking for a woman. I wonder who he wants in his slimy grasp now.''\n'''Papyrus to Elpenor''' ''Elpenor, in regards to your search for the woman. If anyone would know her whereabouts, it would be that [[Chrysis|crazy priestess]] at the [[Sanctuary of Asklepios|Asklepios Sanctuary]]. I'd go myself but she terrifies me. Yours, [[Antonide]].''\nShe then examined his bookshelf.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is a [[ship]] manifest. Elpenor's selling weapons to both Athens and [[Sparta]]. He wants [[Peloponnesian War|this war]] to go on forever. I have met some treacherous people. None of them compare to Elpenor. I'm going to look under every rock, in every shadow, until I find and kill this vile serpent.''",

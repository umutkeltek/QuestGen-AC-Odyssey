But I can't lose any more of my family to war.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If Arion learns to fight, he can protect you and the farm.''\n*'''Anais:''' '' I can't work this farm alone. He won't listen to me, but he looks up to you. I can see it in his eyes.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept - I'll talk to Arion=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll talk to him. But I don't think he's as fond of me as you are.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''You flatter yourself.

You have two separate options here; teach him to fight, or teach him to farm. Your decisions will influence how [[A Night in Tegea]] will play out.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hello Arion.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Hello.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's wrong?''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I miss my'' pater.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Want to talk about it?''\n*'''Arion:''' ''No.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK. You don't have to talk. But you can listen if you want.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I guess.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I lost my father when I was young. I ran far, far away. My only friend in the world was Ikaros. One day, a bully threw a rock and nearly broke his wing.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''What did you do?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I cut off his fingers with this.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''The spear of Leonidas. Can I hold it?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can, but first I need you to do me a favor. Your mother needs you.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''You're going to train me to be a mighty warrior?''\n<tabber>\nI'm going to train you to fight.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will. I think you'd both benefit from having someone around here who can fight.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I'm going to be the fiercest warrior you've seen! I'll cut my enemies into pieces.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stay close and pay attention. I won't have you injuring yourself.''\nKassandra begins with archery training;\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''First, a warrior must be resolute in their decision to kill. When you're face to face with the enemy, you cannot hesitate.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hesitation hastens the grave. My mother taught me that.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''How often should I train?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All day. Every day. And when your hand starts to bleed, switch hands.''\nComplete the archery training\n*'''Arion:''' ''What weapons should I use?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For now we're going to find you a wooden sword.''\nCollect a stick from nearby.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, this should do.''\nReturn to Arion.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're going to learn to fight, you need to use all your senses to anticipate your enemy's every move.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''How'm I supposed to know that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By taking in the enemy before you and trusting your instincts. Watch, I'm going to swing at you from the right side. I want you to defend yourself.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''OK. I'm ready!''\n\nRound one!\n\n{{#tag: tabber|\nSwing right. = \nArion dodges.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Very good!''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I blocked the Eagle Bearer! I'm the greatest warrior who ever lived!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't get cocky. The moment a warrior gets too proud is the moment they get cut down. This time I'm going to attack from the left.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Bring it on!''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLie - Swing left.= \n*'''Arion:''' ''Hey no fair! You said you were going to punch right!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I also said you need to use'' all ''your senses. You heard me say right, but you should have seen me go left. Let's try again, and listen carefully - I'm going to attack you from the left.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''OK.''\n}}\n\nRound two!\n\n{{#tag: tabber|\nSwing left.= \nArion dodges again.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a fast learner!''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I wish ''pater'' could see me now.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLie - Swing right.= \nArion gets mad.\n*'''Arion:''' ''You lied to me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you're not paying attention. Don't let what you hear distract you from what's actually happening right in front of you.''\n}}\n\n*'''Arion:''' '' What happened to the bully whose fingers you cut off?''\n*'''Kasssandra:''' ''He went and got his brothers. They beat me pretty badly.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''You didn't have any friends to protect you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not until a little girl stood between me and those boys, and with the rage of Ares, screamed at them to leave me alone.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Really? A girl? Who?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''That little girl was me.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Whoa, ''mater!''Kassandra taught me to be a mighty warrior like you.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''She did what?''\n\n{{#tag: tabber|I'm a fighter, not a farmer=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You wanted me to teach the boy. I can't teach what I don't know. But what I did teach him, he can -''\n*'''Anais:''' ''He can go to war and die like his father! Like my husband.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you've been through a lot, but you can't protect the boy by living in the past.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''I thought bringing you here would help us have a better future. I thought if you showed an interest in the farm, he'd get excited and maybe give up on becoming a warrior. It was wrong of me to put that burden on your shoulders. I'm sorry.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI did what I thought was best=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did what I thought was best.'' \n*'''Anais:''' ''Best for who, you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Best for both of you.

Like my husband.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you've been through a lot, but you can't protect the boy by living in the past.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''I thought bringing you here would help us have a better future.

I want to be a warrior, like you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whenever I see the sun rise, I'm never sure I'll get to see it set. I walk away from the people I love knowing it might be the last time I ever see them again. Is that the life you want?''\nArion shakes his head.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. Now follow me.''\n\nAs they set about their tasks, they have a chat.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ever heard of the poet [[Hesiod]]?''\n*'''Arion:''' ''No. But I know [[Homer]], and [[Achilles]], and [[Hektor (mythology)|Hector]], and Odysseus and the {{Wiki|Trojan Horse|giant horse}}.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Study Homer if you want to learn to put people in the ground. But study Hesiod and you'll learn to grow things out of it.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Bor-ing!''\n\nKassandra finishes showing Arion how to harvest and they move onto the next task.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And now we're going to burn some bushes.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Why?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For new life to grow, we need to clear away the old.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Why?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Because they choke the earth, stopping new plants from growing.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Why?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Because.''\n\nWith the grass burning complete, Kassandra and Arion prepare for the final task.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now I'm going to show you how to kill a chicken.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''But I love chickens.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're going to feed your family, you're going to have to sacrifice a few chickens. You don't have to kill any today, but watch closely how I do it - clean and precise.''\n\nKill the chickens and talk to Arion again.\n\n*'''Arion:''' '' What happened to the bully whose fingers you cut off?''\n*'''Kasssandra:''' ''He went and got his brothers. They beat me pretty badly.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''You didn't have any friends to protect you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not until a little girl stood between me and those boys, and with the rage of Ares, screamed at them to leave me alone.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Really? A girl? Who?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''That little girl was me.''\n*'''Arion:''' Mater! ''Kassandra taught me how to be a farmer... But you could teach me how to be brave.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Maybe one day I will.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Yeah. She taught me about Hesiod. She taught me to burn the old 'cause it chokes the new, and then she killed a bunch of chickens!''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Sounds like you both had a productive day.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your boy is a fast learner.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Thank you. This means the world to me.''\n\n</tabber>",

I can't let you go any further.''\n(If players choose \"Why are you out here?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It isn't often you see a [[guard]] outside of an artist's workshop.''\n*'''Athenian Light Soldier:''' ''I just do what I'm told, stranger. And until I'm told otherwise, no one is going in or out.''\n(If players choose \"I need to see Phidias.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stand aside.

Better make this one count.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just don't tell anyone I was here.''\n*'''Athenian Light Soldier:''' ''Sure, sure. Keep it moving.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 Phidias is my friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phidias and I have been friends for a long time.

However, she easily dispatched him\n}}\n</tabber>\nEntering the workshop, Kassandra located Phidias on the top floor, working on a sculpture. He dropped his tools in surprise.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sorry about that.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''How did you get past the guard? No one gets past the guard.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Relax. Perikles sent me.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Praise [[Athena]], I knew he'd send help. I was worried they sent someone after me.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|We need to get you out of here.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He sent me to get you out of Athens.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''So he knows about the plot.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean the trial? From what I've seen, you don't stand a chance.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Pah! The people love me. I am ''the'' Phidias! But there are others. Look.''\nHe handed her a rolled up parchment. Kassandra read its contents.\n*'''Kassandra:''' '' ''Malaka''. It isn't the trial that Perikles is saving you from... these are instruction to murder you. Who wrote this?''\n|-|\"They\" seem to scare you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"They\" who?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''The shadows in the night... why you fear falling asleep. They're hunting me. Us. No one is safe in Athens anymore.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're in danger.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you do know. I tried talking to Perikles, but we were interrupted.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThe Cult.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Cult of Kosmos... You know about them .''\n}}\n</tabber>\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Of course I know about the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]]. Here, look at this.''\nHe handed her a rolled up parchment. Kassandra read its contents.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These are instructions...''\n*'''Phidas:''' ''On how to kill me. But they've been torn.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then Perikles isn't just getting you out of Athens to save you from trial... He's saving you from being murdered.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''I don't know who to trust. I'm just an artist... I just wanted to create. Please, what am I to do?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''First, you need to pull yourself together. You're on trial, the people are against you, and now I find that the Cult want to kill you.''\nPhidias began to panick.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I said, pull yourself together.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Yes, of course.''\n(If players choose \"Are the accusation true?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Kleon]] said you're wasting the people's drachmae. If he has his way, he'd serve them your head.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Kleon mentioned me? That's going to hurt Perikles. First impiety, now theft. After all we've done for this city.''\n(If players choose \"Who is Perikles to you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You and Perikles seem close...''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''For Perikles and me, it started with our love of Athens. Our differences push us to greatness. ''That'' is true friendship.''\n(If players choose \"We should get going.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. We need to go. Do you have any idea where I can take you?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''South of Athens, there's an island called [[Seriphos]]. My friend [[Theras]] lives there. When I discovered the plot against me, I sent word to him. If anyone can help us, he can.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. Any clues he has of the Cultists' identities, I want them.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Yes, yes, anything...''\n[[File:ACOD Escape from Athens 04.png|thumb|250px|A guard entering Phidias' workshop]]\nA guard entered the workshop.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''A guard!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll distract them while you sneak out. Meet me tonight to set sail for Seriphos. Don't show your face until you see me at the docks.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''I understand.''\n*'''Athenian Light Soldier:''' ''You didn't really think I'd let you come and go as you pleased, did you? Now, where are you?''\nAs Phidias escaped, Kassandra killed the searching guards, then hurried to meet him at the [[Port of Piraeus]] at night.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Good, you made it. I was beginning to worry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I told you I'd get you out of Athens.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''So you did.''\n(If players choose \"Who is the friend we're meeting?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can your friend be trusted?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Theras and I have been friends for a long time. I just sent word telling him where to meet us.''\n(If players choose \"Let's go.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wasting time will only get us into trouble. Let's head to Seriphos while we still can.''\nThey boarded the ''[[Adrestia]]'' and set sail for Seriphos.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''I never thought I'd leave Athens for good.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've left places I've called home.''\nKassandra spoke to Phidias on the deck.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''I hope leaving Athens was the right thing to do.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course it was. You'll be safe this way.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Will I?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Safer than you were, at least. If the Cult can't find you, they can't kill you. It's simple.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''So long as they don't find me, yes. But who knows where they are... who they are... we could be heading somewhere even more dangerous.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe. But this is your best chance.''\nThey boarded the ship, and left the harbour, avoiding Athenian ships.\n\nAs the ship sailed south, Phidias spoke up.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Hopefully, the Cult won't bother me now that I'm out of Athens.''\nKassandra did not respond. Phidias spoke up again as the ship sailed on.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''This is a nice ship.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't have to do that.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Do what?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fill the silence.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Oh! I wasn't trying to do that at all. I simply don't find myself traveling the seas very often.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It can be freeing.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Yes, \"freeing\" seems to be an accurate word. Although I've begun to feel a bit sick...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lean over the side if you need to, otherwise you're cleaning it up.''\nAs they neared Seriphos, Phidias's seasickness worsened.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Is your stomach turning as much as mine is?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll get used to it. We'll reach Seriphos before long.''\nThey docked at the island at the town of [[Chora, Seriphos|Chora]]. Phidias' friend Theras greeted them.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''It's good to see you alive and well, Phidias!''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''And you, Theras. As you can see, I didn't get here alone.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Ah, yes, the kind and thoughtful hero you mentioned in your letter!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I just wanted Phidias safe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad I could get him out alive.''\n|-|I did this for myself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I wasn't getting something out of it, He'd be dead already.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Civilian:''' ''And for that heroism, I've found some information on a man named [[Brison]] who's plotting Phidias's early demise. Hopefully, you can make something of this clue.''\nKassandra examined the parchment Theras handed to her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Please give Perikles my thanks and my farewell. And be careful\u2014I still believe many in Athens are in danger.''",

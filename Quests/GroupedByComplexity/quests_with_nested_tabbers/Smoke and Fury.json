    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra travelled to Darius' hideout in Messene. There, she reunited with him and the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Messenia Athenian General|general]] she had saved earlier.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius.''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''We meet again, Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Good, you're back. Now to set our plan in motion.''\nDarius pointed to his notes on the wall.\n*'''Darius:''' ''We will set several fires. The smoke will force the [[helot]]s to flee and draw Amorges' [[guards]] down from the [[Andania Mine|mine]].''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''Striking at the heart of the enemy while minimizing the cost of innocent lives. A wise plan. I will see to it that my men light up the rest of the area.''\nThe general left.\n*'''Darius:''' ''What happened?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I found out about Natakas.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Natakas]] died protecting [[Elpidios]]. [[Gergis|Someone]] from the Order wanted to meet with me. He was there Darius, they found Natakas in the shipwreck. He tried to fight them all...''\nDarius nodded and said nothing. He turned to the table containing keepsakes belonging to Natakas.\n*'''Darius:''' ''This was Natakas'. I haven't had a chance to... I forgot I even took it.<br />He's gone. He's really gone. And he's never coming back.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll never forget Natakas.=\nKassandra's composure cracked.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll never forget, Darius. I miss him. Even now.

It's time to get him back.''\n|-|Nothing happened.=\nKassandra began to speak, then closed her eyes and brushed it off.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's nothing.''\n|-|(Did not learn how Natakas died)=\nKassandra began to speak, then closed her eyes and brushed it off.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's nothing.''\n</tabber>\nDarius nodded and led the way out of the hideout.\n\nAs night fell, Darius and Kassandra gathered at the lumberyard outside, the former holding a torch.\n*'''Darius:''' ''If Amorges is here, Elpidios must be as well. Once we start, we can't go back. They'll come at us with all they've got.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 Let's do this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's time to attack.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''The price may be... ''everything.\nKassandra nodded her head. Darius handed her the torch.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know the price.''\n|-|Not yet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not yet. We need to be more prepared. We can't let that snake get away this time.''\nDarius winced at her quizzically.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Fine, but our time is running out.''\nKassandra left to better prepare herself for the final assault against Amorges as Darius returned to the warehouse. In time, she returned, and Darius brought her back out to the lumberyard.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Elpidios is close. As is Amorges. We need to do this now, Kassandra.''\n(back to choices)\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra threw the torch at a stack of lumber. The fire consumed the stack and spread throughout the lumberyard, alerting the workers and the Order guards.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Fire! Get out of here!''\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''What the\u2014''\nDarius and Kassandra observed the scene while perched on a post extending from a nearby roof.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Time to find the boy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It is.''\n\nDarius and Kassandra split up. She descended from the roof and navigated throughout the lumberyard to take out the Order soldiers assembling at several points to the west, south, and east of the lumberyard. She started with the soldiers to the west, nearest the building.\n*'''Soldier:''' ''We'll get her this time. Surround the area. Flush the Eagle Bearer out.''\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''Hold your ground. We can't let the Eagle Bearer get away!''\n*'''Soldier:''' ''What are you afraid of? Pull yourself together!''\nKassandra killed the soldiers and moved towards the group to the south.\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''Search every house. The Eagle Bearer is nearby. Watch your back!''\nKassandra dispatched the group and moved towards the third group to the east.\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''They're somewhere here. Keep your eyes peeled!''\n*'''Soldier:''' ''I can't see anything! The smoke is too thick\u2014this is useless!''\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''We only leave when we get the Eagle Bearer's head! We're gonna find you. We're gonna kill you!''\nKassandra dispatched the third group.\n\nWith the Order guards dead, Kassandra left the lumberyard and continued north towards the mines. She followed the trail of dead Order guards and found Darius away from the main path standing over one more, who was on his knees begging for his life. She joined his interrogation while the Athenian general led his men forward and clashed with [[Sparta]]n guards.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Where is Amorges?''\nKassandra grabbed the Order guard by the neck.\n*'''Soldier:''' ''The mines! But you'll never get around his defenses.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll destroy Amorges' defenses.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll crush his defenses. And then I'll kill him.''\n|-|I'll try to find a way through.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing is impenetrable. We'll find a way in.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra released the soldier.\n*'''Soldier:''' ''You're insane. Both of you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're going to tell Amorges that the Eagle Bearer\u2014the great disruption of the Greek world\u2014is here at his door.''\nShe grabbed him again by the collar for emphasis.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You tell him I'm coming. For him. For Elpidios. And I don't knock.''\nShe threw him back, and he ran off to deliver her warning. Meanwhile, the Athenian general's men defeated the Spartans, but they were overwhelmed when Order archers shot them in the back. Kassandra went for her spear and prepared to attack, but Darius refocused her on their task.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Go! I'll take care of the Order guards.''\nDarius moved to cover Kassandra's flank. She choked on some of the smoke as she advanced towards the mines.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get to the mines. I'll take out as many as I can on the way.''\nKassandra took out several guards and entered the mine.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He must be here somewhere.''\nShe navigated through the mines.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't hide from me, Amorges!''\nShe continued deeper into the mines as the sounds of battle faded into the distance.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's too quiet.''\nShe came across a large chamber with scrolls around.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stop hiding, Amorges! Come get what you deserve.''\n\nAs she waited, someone approached her from behind.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Gergis spared=\n*'''[[Gergis]]:''' ''We meet again, Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know this can't end well, Gergis. Just walk away.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''It's not that simple. Amorges has orders, and I have duties to fulfil. And... I have no intention of walking away, Kassandra. After all I've written about you, learned of your feats\u2014I know I can't defeat you. Yet I cannot simply stand aside. We both have our reasons. For me, it's [[Iran|Persia]]. Make it through me, and Amorges awaits you in the [[Temple of Zeus, Messenia|temple]].''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nWe don't have to do this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Amorges is using you! Don't be stupid. We don't have to fight.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I do this of my own accord and my duty and devotion to Persia. The will of Amorges has nothing to do it.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThere's no choice but to fight.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know there's no talking you out of this. In another time, things might have been different for us. But\u2014''<br />''Not this time.''\nGergis gave a short nod.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Unfortunately.''\n}}\nGergis took his mark on the rug in front of her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your loyalty to your home and commander are admirable, Gergis. But the Order has no place in the [[Greece|Greek]] world.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Everything the Order has done, everything I have done, has been in service of a cause greater than any individual's.''\nGergis' guards came over.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, all the deaths and suffering... That is justified?''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''For all the greater good, Kassandra\u2014<br />[[The Creed|All things are permitted.]]''\nKassandra struck down Gergis and his guards, then confirmed that Gergis was dead.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We didn't have to do this.''\n|-|Gergis killed=\nA number of Order scribes encircled her, bearing an unsettling fascination with her.\n*'''Order Scribe (female):''' ''Look, the Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Order Scribe (short-haired male):''' ''Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is\u2014''\n*'''Order Scribe (long-haired male):''' ''Amorges? He's in the [[Temple of Zeus, Messenia|temple]] above the mines. But that time will come.''\n*'''Order Scribe (female):''' ''She's just like Gergis described in his entries. Fierce.''\n*'''Order Scribe (short-haired):''' ''Oh, Gergis. He was the best of us.\n*'''Order Scribe (long-haired):''' You were his favourite character, Eagle Bearer. And yet you murdered him.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI had to kill Gergis.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I had no choice.

She still has her littlest warrior in her heart.''\n*'''Order Scribe (short-haired):''' ''She still has... ''hope.\n*'''Order Scribe (female):''' ''What a foolish thing to hold on to.''\nThe Order Scribes laughed.\n*'''Order Scribe (long-haired):''' ''We will fight for Persia until our dying breath. The lives, the razed cities. It is for Amorges' vision of peace. His grand design. [[The Creed|All things are permitted.]]''\nKassandra fought and eliminated the scribes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Amorges is in the temple. I'm coming Elpidios. I'll find you.''\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra read a scroll.\n*'''Chronicles:'''<br />''A record of the [[Order of the Ancients]]' history throughout the ages, maintained by the Herald and his scribes. The Order was founded many generations ago in the faraway land of [[Egypt]], and spread over time to Persia and beyond. Maddeningly, much of the document is obscured by code and cipher. The full extent of the Order's reach is unknown, but it is clear that Amorges and those who serve him are but one part of a vast and greater conspiracy that threatens the entire world.''\nShe read another scroll.\n*'''After the Storm:'''<br />''[[Achaia]]. Where the Order of the Ancients tasked the [[Phila|Tempest]] to brew up a storm. The Eagler Bearer, no stranger to helping those in need, sought to help stranded refugees leave such dangerous waters. But the Great Disruptor was soon caught in the midst of a tragic family feud. And with her final breath, the Tempest passed onto memory. The Eagle Bearer settled in [[Dyme]], looking after baby Elpidios while watching the once-raging waves now gently lap at the shore.<br /><br />- The Herald''\nShe read another scroll.\n*'''A New Beginning:'''<br />''For decades [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]] brought peace and prosperity, but Persia needs more.<br /><br />From promise of legacy and glory to coercion and threat, unlike his predecessors, Artaxerxes refused to yield. But the Order needed him dethroned. We led him to believe that Artabanus made the attempt on his life.<br /><br />Artaxerxes lived, but no matter. The King is ephemeral.<br /><br />The Order is eternal.<br /><br />- The Herald.''",

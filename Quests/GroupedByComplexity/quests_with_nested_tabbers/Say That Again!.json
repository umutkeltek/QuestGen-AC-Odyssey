She then headed to the Temple of Britomartis. The place had been taken over by soldiers, but she made her way in, and discovered a chest.\n*'''Kasssandra:''' ''This must be where they keep the obsidian glass.''\nAfter obtaining enough obsidian glass, Kassandra returned to the blacksmith and his apprentice.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here's your obsidian glass.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Excellently done, ''misthios''.

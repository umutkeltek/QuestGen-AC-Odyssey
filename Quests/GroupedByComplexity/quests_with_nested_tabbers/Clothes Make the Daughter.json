I'll infiltrate their village and live among them. Can you help me? I'll pay you all the [[drachma]]e I have.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll help you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you.''\nDespite this, Kassandra warned her of the risk.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Daughters of Artemis are dangerous, and if you're found out...''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I accept the risks. What I'll need you to do is get me a piece of their [[armor]], headgear, and [[boot]]s.''\n(If \"Where are the boots?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find the boots?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''There's a [[Artemis Cave|cave]] in the cliffs on the western side of the Daughters' village where they train new recruits. They tested me there, but I left my boots behind when they kicked me out.''\n(If \"Where can I find the armor?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any idea where I can find the armor you need?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''There's a small [[Huntress Outpost Camp|outpost camp]] just south of the Daughters' village. You'll find extra armor there. They barely defend it\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Easy.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''\u2014Which is why it was recently overrun with beasts even they can't tame.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ah.''\n(If \"Where is the headgear?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where to find the headgear.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''You'll find it around the hut of the Daughters' most favored huntress, near the center of their village.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"That's all I need to know.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll come back when I have the gear.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''. You'll have to be stealthy to get the items, and please avoid harming any of the Daughters if you can.''\nThe young woman returned to her seat and Kassandra set off for the [[Huntress Village]].\n[[File:ACOD Clothes Make the Daughter 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra arriving at the Daughters of Artemis camp ]]\nFrom the outskirts of the village, [[Ikaros]] identified the hut where the headgear could be found.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That must be the hut of the favorite daughter.''\nIkaros then found the cave containing the boots.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That must be the cave where the boots are.''\nKassandra made her way to the hut. She pondered the condition of the village compared to the other Artemis camps.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's something different about this village.''\n[[File:ACOD Clothes Make the Daughter 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra recovering the boots from the chest]]\nKassandra claimed the headgear from a [[Treasure chest|chest]] near the central hut. She made her way to the western cave and found the boots in a different chest. Kassandra crept out of the village and made her way southwest to the outpost camp, where Ikaros identified the chest containing the armor.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The outpost camp.''\n[[File:ACOD Clothes Make the Daughter 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra arriving at the huntress camp]]\nKassandra slew the wolves that had overrun the camp and claimed the armor. With all three items in hand, she made her way back to the young woman.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've got the gear you asked for, but remember\u2014the Daughters of Artemis are legendary warriors. If you choose to infiltrate them, it's likely you'll be killed.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''What choice do I have?''\n|-|If Kassandra had already collected the armor=\n*'''Civilian:''' Misthios''.

They don't quite fit me.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''! I'll finally be able to infiltrate the Daughters of Artemis and join my sisters.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You might want to reconsider.

Thinking I'm not tough enough.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Taking a life isn't easy, and it can't be undone. You aren't a killer.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''You don't know me. I can do it!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can see good in you. You're passionate, determined\u2014why not help others?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Really? You think ''I'' could do that?''\nThe young woman decided what to do.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I know... I'll become a priestess\u2014and join a temple! Thank you, ''misthios''!''\nKassandra met up with her later.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Misthios! Remember me? You convinced me not to infiltrate the Daughters of Artemis. You saved my life, though\u2014I don't yet know what to do with it.''\n|-|Risk almost certain death.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's a high price to pay for chasing what we want - maybe even death. You must be willing to pay it.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Yes. This is something I must do.''\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra handed the equipment to the woman, and either supported her plan or convinced her to follow another path.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "The name of the memory is a play on the idiom \"clothes make the man.\"\n\nThe quest can overlap with \"[[Hard to Artemis]]\", in that the [[Artemis Cave]] is one of the targets for both quests.  If Ikaros highlights the cave while both quests are active, then both of Kassandra's comments tied to each highlight will play simultaneously.\n\nIronically, if players had already completed the memory \"[[Artemis's Request]]\", in which Kassandra joins the Daughters of Artemis as their new leader despite being an outsider herself as she had warned the civilian, there is no effect on the dialogue in this quest.",

Blow them up!''\n(If players choose \"Who are the Cerberus brothers?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You couldn't have mentioned there were three of them before?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''I thought it was implied.

I'm pretty sure it's the farm in Astypalia City... Their goons are always hanging around.''\n<tabber>\n|-| If the silos weren't already burned down=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got it.''\nKassandra approached the farm near [[Astypalia City]]. Spotting a silo, she set it on fire\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's one silo down.''\nAs Kassandra approached another silo, she overheard a farmer.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''What the fuck? My silos! Stop!''\nKassandra burned down another silo.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One more silo to go.''\nKassandra approached another silo and similarly burned it down.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Done. I'll tell Markos it made quite the impression.''\n\n|-| If the silos were already burned down=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The farm in Astypalia City? I burned those silos, and I didn't see any Cerberus there.''\n*'''Markos:''' '' What? Their soldiers are always hanging around...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure. There were only scared farmers.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''No dogs and no Cerberus... Maybe it's not their farm after all. We sure dodged that arrow.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It won't stop the Cereberus from coming for you.''\n(Transitions into [[Markos's Fate]])\n</tabber>",

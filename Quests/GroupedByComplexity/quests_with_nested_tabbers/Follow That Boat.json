    "Section_Dialogue": "At the [[Bellerophron's Garden|market]] in [[Korinth]], Kassandra found Erinna calling for [[Kleio|someone]].\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Kleio? Kleio? Has anyone seen Kleio?''\nKassandra approached Erinna.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''By [[Aphrodite]], Kleio better get back here soon.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm friends with Aphrodite.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why call on the gods when you have one of their messengers at your service?''\n|-|You'll have to settle for a mortal.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe there's something a [[mercenary]] can do for you?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Erinna:''' ''How'd you know I needed help?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anthousa told me you could use a hand.''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Kleio, one of our girls, didn't meet me for prayer this morning. She wasn't at home, either. I'd go investigate but I'm not sure what I could do on my own.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She might have been taken.''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''I asked around. One of our clients said he saw Kleio brought aboard a ship. The men were armed, so there was nothing he could do. I'd pay a lot of [[drachma]]e to get her back.''\n(Accept - I'll find her.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Armed? Take me to the ship. We'll get Kleio back.''\nErinna led the way to a nearby stable.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Follow me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who do you think they took her?''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''It wouldn't be the first time [[the Monger]]'s men came after one of us.''\n[[File:ACOD_Erinna_Kassandra_Horse_Ride.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra following Erinna]]\nThey mounted their [[horse]]s and begun to make their way to the [[Port of Lechaion]].\n*'''Erinna:''' ''None of us have ever disappeared like this before. Some are worried they'll be taken next.''\nAs the two approached the port, Erinna and Kassandra talked.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Korinth may have a bad reputation, but it wasn't always that way. We used to be safe.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Until the Monger...''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''We're not sure why he came here, but Korinth is worse off because of him.''\nAt the port, they dismounted as they spotted a [[Piracy|pirate]] [[ship]] in the distance.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''There! That's the boat our client described. Please, get her back safely.''\n[[File:ACOD Follow That Boat 02.png|thumb|250px|Kleio holding a knife against Kassandra]]\nKassandra boarded the ''[[Adrestia]]'' and sailed in pursuit of the [[Piracy|pirate]] [[trireme]]. Drawing near, they attacked the ship and disabled its defenses. Kassandra then boarded the ship with her crew, eliminating the pirates. She found Kleio on the ship and dragged her over to the ''Adrestia''. Once there, Kleio fled her grasp, holding out a knife.\n*'''Kleio:''' ''Stay back!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here to rescue you.''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''Rescue me? You sunk my boat, pirate!''\n<tabber>\n|-|You don't have to be afraid.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Put the knife away. I'm a friend.''\nKleio put away the knife.\n*'''Kleio:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your friend hired me to save you from these men and bring you back.''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''Erinna?! I commissioned that ship to steal me away from Korinth.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're... escaping? From what?''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''You have no idea what the Monger does to people. The things I've seen. No one in Korinth is safe.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou scared your friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Erinna thought you were abducted. She clearly cares about you.''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''If she cared about me, she'd let me go. Even Anthousa can't keep us safe anymore.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She clearly disagrees.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou have freedom in Korinth.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Greece|Greek]] world is being ravaged by [[Peloponnesian War|war]]. You're no safer on the seas than you are in Korinth.''\n}}\n|-|A pirate? Never!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Me? An [[Bandit|outlaw]]? You wound me.''\nKleio put the knife away, hands on her hips.\n*'''Kleio:''' ''What are you talking about?''\n|-|No one points a knife at me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''.''\n</tabber>\nKleio clasped her hands together, begging Kassandra.\n*'''Kleio:''' Misthios'', please. We were heading to [[Mykonos]], which ''is'' safe. If you'll take me there, I can pay you the toll I'd have paid my crew.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll take you to Mykonos=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll get you there. Next time my crew docks at Mykonos, you can depart. In the meantime, welcome aboard.''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''! This is what's best, I promise.''\n(Cue [[Escort Service]])<br>\nAfter agreeing to escort Kleio to Mykonos, Kassandra returned to Erinna in Korinth.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''What happened? Where's Kleio?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nShe's safe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your friend is safe. That's what matters.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nShe didn't want to come back.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your friend didn't need rescuing. She hired that ship to get out of Korinth and go somewhere safe.''\n}}\n*'''Erinna:''' ''So. She's really gone.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's not coming back, no.''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Thank you. I'll let Anthousa know. Guess I'll be alone at prayer tomorrow. You promise she's safe?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have my word.''\n|-|Back to Korinth with you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anthousa will take care of you. You need to go back to Korinth. It's your home.''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''Take me against my wishes, then. I won't fight you.''\nKassandra returned to Erinna with Kleio, who was overjoyed at seeing her friend anew.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Kleio! Did they hurt you? I prayed to [[Tyche]] for your safe return!''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''I'm fine, I'm fine.''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''There'd better not be a scratch on you. I promised this mercenary a month's salary to have you back in one piece.''\n*'''Kleio:''' ''You did?''\n*'''Erinna:''' ''Of course! You're my dear sister.''\nShe turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Erinna:''' ''I'm so thankful Kleio is home. Please, take this for your trouble.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good luck to both of you.''\n</tabber>",

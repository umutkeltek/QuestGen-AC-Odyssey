Are you all right?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''They took him. The bandits who killed my ''pater'' took Timotheos!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where did they go?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''To the ruins of Mycenae! Please, you have to help him!''\n\nShe quickly made her way to the ruins. After killing the bandits in her way, she found Timotheos tied up. \n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos! We have to get out of here.

Or at least I was. Until I had to terminate our arrangement.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''You mean you had him killed?''\n*'''Hypatos''' ''A last resort. Our partnership funded poor Diokles's gambling for years. His mistake was gambling not with drachmae he earned from me, but with drachmae he ''stole'' from me.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''You're lying. There's no way our ''pater'' would ever work with you.''\n*'''Hypatos''' ''Believe what you want.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra rescued Timotheos from the bandits at [[Mycenae]]. Aterwards Kassandra had to deal with [[Hypatos (Bandit)|Hypatos]], the murderer of [[Diokles (Fisherman)|Diokles]], by either killing him, paying him, or killing [[The Monger]] publicly. After dealing with Hypatos, Kassandra has the option of dating one of the two brothers, or decline both offers.",

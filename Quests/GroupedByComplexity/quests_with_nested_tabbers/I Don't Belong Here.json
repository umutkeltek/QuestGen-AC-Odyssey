Deep down, I hoped I'd never have to face Deimos again.''\n(If \"What is the Forgotten Sepulchre?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What can you tell me about this Forgotten Sepulchre?\"''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''It houses the [[armor]], trophies, and weapons of dishonored warriors. Things they were buried with in death, but were stripped of in the underworld.''\n(If \"How will I know your shield?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How will I know which shield is yours?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You should know my shield by now. It bears the colors of Sparta and has been through many battles.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll come back with your shield.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The weight of your shield will help you feel like your old self.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Make sure to take only mine. Taking any others will be your doom.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra reunited with Brasidas in the underworld, though she had expected him to deserve Elysium instead. She resolved to help him face his greatest enemy and earn his way into paradise.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "Much of the dialogue depends on if Kassandra and Brasidas were on \"good\" or \"bad terms\" when he died, and if Kassandra had killed Nikolaos in the memory \"[[The Wolf of Sparta]]\". Furthermore, if players had reached Level 52 early on and began ''The Fate of Atlantis'' before completing the memory \"[[We Will Rise]]\", leaving Brasidas alive before his death in the Battle of Amphipolis, his shade will still appear, as his death is unavoidable in the main storyline. When asked about Deimos, players are given answers from the \"Deimos is alive\" table.",

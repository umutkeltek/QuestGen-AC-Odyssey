I told you to stay out of my way\u2014yet here you are.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, what? I'm a prisoner until I'm killed?''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''That's the plan. Or ''I'' could come in there and end you anytime I please. But before that. Tell me what you know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought your Cultists told you everything. Sounds like you're on their side, but they're not on yours.''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''You think I'm just a puppet? Then prove it to me. Tell me why ''I'm'' on the wrong side. Convince me\u2014I dare you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you want to know?''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''Everything you claim to be true. But after this, I kill you. Why was I abandoned that night on the [[Mount Taygetos|mountain]]?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It was the prophecy.=\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was the [[Praxithea|Pythia]]'s prophecy.

What kind of prophecy would lead to that?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe prophecy said you'd doom Sparta.=\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Pythia said you were going to bring Sparta to greatness... or to its downfall. Waiting for the outcome was too big a risk.''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''A risk.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I heard you're unpredictable.''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''I call it being decisive. You weren't decisive that night. You\u2014\"my family\"\u2014let me go.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Let you go\"?

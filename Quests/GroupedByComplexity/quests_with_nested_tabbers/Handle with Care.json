I was hoping to see you again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Alkibiades. What are you doing outside of [[Athens]]?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Someone like me is always on the move. I've docked my ship in ''every'' \"port\"!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure you have.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''If you're here for more than the view, I have a task for you. It is ''crucial'' this package gets to its proper recipient. It's not from me, but a man named [[Diodoros (military officer)|Diodoros]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Find another messenger.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll have to find another delivery girl.''\nKassandra left Alkibiades, only to change her mind and return later.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Did you regret turning down my package?''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll deliver the package.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help, but it's only that little box?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''One should never judge something by its size, you know. A small thing may very well make a ''huge'' impact.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I should get going.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. Who am I giving the package to?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''There's a man named Bardas near the [[Korinthia]]n [[Akrokorinth Fort|military fort]]. He's one of their stronger... assets.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And I just tell him it's from you?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''No, from Diodoros. Don't forget. Diodoros.''\n|-|Why do you have this package?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said this package isn't from you. Why do you have it, then?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It simply came into my hands, that's all. Diodoros asked for my help, like I'm asking for yours now.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why can't this Diodoros deliver it himself?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''You're a curious one, aren't you? Some questions don't have answers. Sometimes things just... are.''\n|-|What's your favorite 'port'?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've traveled a lot\u2014where's your favorite place to go?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Oh, a personal question... interesting.<br>The world is filled with beautiful places. To pick my favorite would be like picking my favorite hetaera. I could do it, but the answer changes based on my mood.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra infiltrated the Akrokorinth Fort and entered Bardas' office.\n[[File:ACOD Handle with Care 02.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra meeting Bardas]]\n*'''Bardas:''' ''You aren't the ''misthios'' I sent for. What do you want?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is for you.''\n*'''Bardas:''' ''Give it here.''\nKassandra handed over the package and Bardas unwrapped it.\n*'''Bardas:''' ''Is this some kind of joke? This is a cast of someone's dick! What's this engraving? \"This is for your wife [[Thelia]], for when she starts to miss me.\"''\nEnraged, Bardas turned his full attention to Kassandra.\n*'''Bardas:''' ''Tell me now! Who sent this?''\n<tabber>\n|-|It's from Diodoros.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know a man named Diodoros?''\n*'''Bardas:''' ''Diodoros? He'll pay for this with his life! I'll destroy his men. I'll destroy his ship. He'll regret ever touching Thelia!''\nKassandra left Bardas enraged at Diodoros.\n|-|It's from Alkibiades.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A man named Alkibiades gave it to me.''\n*'''Bardas:''' ''Alkibiades? Just because [[Perikles]] took him in and he's friends with important people, he thinks he can do whatever he wants. I won't let him get away with this!''\nKassandra left Bardas to his indignation at Alkibiades.\n|-|It's from me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's from me, Bardas, can't you tell?''\n*'''Bardas:''' ''Do you think this is a joke? You'll pay for that!''\nBardas attacked Kassandra, leaving her no choice but to kill him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone doesn't have a sense of humor.''\n</tabber>\nHer mission complete, Kassandra returned to Alkibiades at the Temple of Aphrodite to tell him the outcome.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I was just starting to miss you. I hope you delivered the package.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Told Bardas it was from Diodoros.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bardas threatened to kill Diodoros when I told him. I also wasn't expecting the package to be... well... that.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It ''was'' a nice surprise, wasn't it? I can make another one for you, too, if you'd like.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Another one? You\u2014''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It was mine, yes. It looked good, didn't it? I needed to get Diodoros out of the way, and now he will be. I impress myself sometimes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever you say.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Why don't we let our bodies do the talking? Surely you had thoughts of it as well when you saw the cast of me...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here? Before the [[Greek mythology|gods]]?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Let's make an ''offering.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nSex in a temple sounds fun.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like to see the gods stop us.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I have a feeling they'd prefer to watch.''\nAlkibiades and Kassandra shared a moment in the temple. Kassandra emerged a while later, followed by Alkibiades.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd say we gave the gods a good show.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I couldn't agree more. I'd love an encore soon.''\nAlkibiades left.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThat's a terrible idea.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not interested.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''A shame... Aphrodite would have loved it. Maybe another time.''\n}}\n|-|Told Bardas it was from Alkibiades.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I told Bardas that... it came from you.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''You did what? I specifically told you to say it was from Diodoros.<br>Now I have to come up with another plan. It took me a long time to make that final cast.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait, so it ''was'' yours?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Yes, that impressive specimen was mine. I really wish you hadn't told him that. You can go now. I need to think.''\n|-|Lied to Bardas.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought I'd make a joke and tell him it was mine, but he didn't laugh.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Why would you do that? Bardas is an angry, emotional man. I hoped to get rid of Diodoros, but now you've ruined that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you wanted to get rid of Diodoros, then that package wasn't from him after all.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Of course not. It was a perfect plan, but now I have to come up with something else. Don't think I'll ever make a cast for ''you'' now.''\n</tabber>",

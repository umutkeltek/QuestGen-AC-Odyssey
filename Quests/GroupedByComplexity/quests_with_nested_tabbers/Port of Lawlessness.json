    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra destroyed the Monger's warehouse, sending a powerful message to Korinth and the Monger, and met Brasidas in the process.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Killing the Monger's men during the final fight with Brasidas triggers murder bounties for each kill. Either they can act as witnesses to each other's murder, or Brasidas is improperly flagged as a potential witness to crimes, as there are no other NPCs around during this fight.\n:*To avoid this, simply damage them just enough that Brasidas can deliver the killing blow. Alternatively, players can use the automatic bounty(ies) to lure in bounty hunters to kill and raise the hero's mercenary rank, but be warned that allied NPCs like Brasidas will not aid the player in mercenary fights.",

From the past.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Oh. Did you borrow [[drachmae]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not that kind of debt. Few people would take in a runaway they caught [[Thief|thieving]]. I was just a kid.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Huh. I'm just a kid. And I've done pretty good myself.''\n|-|He doesn't boss me around.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He doesn't.

Why?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''People there are sick\u2014and my friend [[Kynna]] is too. There's a blood fever. They say it's a curse and that they need help from the gods.''\n[[File:ACOD The Blood Fever - Kassandra Accept Phoibe's Request.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra accepted Phoibe's request]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I told you.

The sick must join the dead if we are to save the living!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You burned the whole village?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Many nights were lost praying. We had to take action\u2014to scorch the blood fever out of Kausos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is there no hope for a cure?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Nothing has worked. Sacrifice, prayers...''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Healers won't come near us, [[soldier]]s won't let us leave... The gods won't answer our prayers!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But I don't know anything about plague.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''There's nothing you can do.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''No!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''If you intervene, I will be forced to defend the god's wills.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Save us from him! Have pity!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''We aren't even sick! We'll get better!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Nobody gets better! This is the only way all of [[Kephallonia]] will save itself from extermination!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Please!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''We have children!

Some \"man of the gods.\"''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''The real gods sent you. Time to go. We're well enough to travel, but need healing.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Before you go\u2014take my drachmae.

They'll bless you for this!''\nKassandra left the village, allowing the priest to go ahead with the killing. Phoibe confronted Kassandra.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You... you didn't save them? What about Kynna? She's my friend!''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThey weren't mine to save.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How could I make that choice?

You want it to be like this everywhere?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''No... But maybe Kynna would get better. They could be wrong about her!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And maybe the sickness would take the family tomorrow. It's impossible to tell.''\n}}\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I hope you're right.''\nKassandra squat down to comfort Phoibe.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sometimes, good people die, Phoibe. No matter how much we don't like it.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I know... I just wish it wasn't true.''\nPhoibe walked away.\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped Phoibe to look into the blood fever plaguing the village of her friend. She was left to decide the family's fate.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "The choices made in this memory will affect the dialogue later in the game. If Kassandra chooses to attack the priest and save the family, she will later be informed by [[Barnabas]] that the blood fever has spread throughout the island, turning it into a graveyard. Phoibe will tell Kassandra upon [[Perikles's Symposium|meeting her]] anew in [[Athens]] that she heard there\u2019s a plague in Kephallonia. Not interfering with the priest's plans to kill the family will leave the young parents and their children dead, but save Kephallonia. It is also possible to skip this mission during Chapter 1, in which case the plague will eventually spread across the island.\n\nThe priest and his two temple guards have unique avatars when viewed by Ikaros. They can be knocked out and recruited as lieutenants for the [[Adrestia]] after the option to knock out is unlocked in [[Equal Employment Opportunity Program]].",

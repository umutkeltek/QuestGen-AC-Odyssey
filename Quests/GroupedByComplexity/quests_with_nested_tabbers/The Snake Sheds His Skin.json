Never mind, let's go.''\n\nKassandra and Elpenor drew their weapons and charged inside.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|(plan followed)=\nElpenor engaged the escaped prisoners and cleared the way for Kassandra to chase the Monger.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''Fuck!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Monger...

I told you I'd take are of these guards. Go, get the Monger!''\nA third group of enemies attacked the two, but they also were killed by Kassandra and Elpenor.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''What part of letting me handle the other prisoners didn't you understand? Let's get to the Monger - quickly now!''\nElpenor ran further into the temple in hope it wasn't to late to catch the Monger. Kassandra followed, only to find a frustrated Elpenor.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Don't tell me the Monger got away.

Kassandra cast the Monger into the abyss, and Elpenor joined her to take stock of their victory.\n<!--Dialogue varies significantly but always ends up at one of the two choices. I got the \"calmer\" dialogue after listening to his plan + following his plan + not leaving him behind in \"Arms of Atonement\", but it is possible to get the \"angry\" dialogue after the \"followed/broke the plan,\" which is its own line. \u2013 Kathargos-->\n<tabber>\n|-|Followed the plan=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''We make a good pair. At first I was worried you wouldn't stick to the plan\u2014you haven't been very trusting of me.''\n|-|Broke the plan=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''We had a plan to keep the Monger from escaping. You should have trusted me!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can you really blame me? You and the Cult destroyed my life.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Cleared path for Elpenor in Kronos' Treasury?=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I understand, but tell me you see that I've changed. That I'm trying to do good in death where I failed in life. I cannot move on without your acceptance.''\n|-|Abandoned Elpenor in Kronos' Treasury?=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I have done nothing but try to redeem myself in your eyes. But still, you refuse to give me a chance.''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|Kill \u2013 To Tartaros with you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've heard enough of your lies for two lifetimes.''\nKassandra swiftly kicked Elpenor off the cliff into the abyss of death below. Elpenor screamed while Hades simply clapped.\n*'''Hades:''' ''I always find it satisfying to best an adversary twice, don't you?''\n[[Poseidon]] joined them. Hades had won their wager regarding Elpenor's fate.\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''Enough gloating, brother. She already kicked him in the pit. You won the bet.''\nHe flipped Hades a coin.\n*'''Hades:''' ''Elpenor. What a useless pawn.''\n|-|I can see you've changed.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I suppose... you have changed. A bit.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''My dear Eagle Bearer, you have no idea what your forgiveness means to me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who said anything about forgiveness?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I feel as though I can finally move on.''\nHades joined them.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Hades! I\u2014we returned the Monger to Tartaros for you, just as you asked.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''I made no such request.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''But you referred to the Monger as a thorn in your side.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''And you inferred that I wanted him returned. Clearly you still have much to learn, Elpenor. We'll discuss this later at my [[Hades' Palace|palace]].''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Still, I'm on my way to eternal peace, thanks to you.''\nElpenor took his leave as [[Poseidon]] arrived to join Kassandra and Hades. He had won their wager regarding Elpenor's fate.\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''I believe you're forgetting something, brother?''\nHades flipped him a coin while staring down Kassandra.\n*'''Hades:''' ''Why would you help your enemy find peace?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought you and Elpenor were working together.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Elpenor was merely a means to further along ''your'' far more interesting journey.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any chance this means you'll teach me more about the [[Staff of Hermes Trismegistus|Staff]] now?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Patience, Keeper. A few more twists are still to come along your path. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all plays out.''\n<tabber>\n|-|This isn't theater.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''First Elpenor, now you. I am so sick of everyone using my life for their entertainment.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''It's far more than that.''\n|-|You're testing me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You used Elpenor as some sort of trial for me.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Close. But the [[Fates]] wove your path with a defter hand than that.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you talking about?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''You'll know soon enough.''\nHades and Poseidon took their leave of Kassandra.",

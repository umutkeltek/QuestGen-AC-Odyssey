    "Section_Trivia": "*Should the player retrieve the axe before talking to the Priestess, there will be no dialogue to find Swordfish.\n*Should\u00a0the player retrieve the axe after talking to the Priestess, there will be\u00a0dialogue pointing to where Swordfish lives, so long as [[Blood in the Water (Odyssey)|Blood in the Water]] is active and the player has not already dove into his sanctuary below the lighthouse.\n*Whether or not the player gets the dialogue to find Swordfish, the \"investigation\" bar for 'Blood in the Water' will automatically fill one-third of the way upon completion of this quest. Completing the investigation is not required to find Swordfish; he is automatically loaded into the world upon completion of [[Myths and Minotaurs]], and 'Blood in the Water' automatically updates upon entering his sanctuary below the lighthouse.\n*The memory also serves as a support quest for the [[Of Minotaurs and Men]] memory.\n*If the axe is kept, it can be equipped as a Rare Heavy Bladed weapon.",

It's a recipe that guarantees eternal love.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's an honest way to save a relationship.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''It's simple. I'll \"borrow\" his precious [[armor]] for a few days, coat the inside, and let the potion seep through his skin\u2014straight to his heart.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So... Drakon will be left without his armor. Aren't you worried he'll be vulnerable?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Oh, he's the strongest, most ''chiseled'' man in Thebes. He'll be fine without it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good to know.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''My problem is the ''last'' ingredient. I need to buy the rarest herb in Boeotia from my herbalist, but she hasn't come to Thebes in a while.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll find the herbalist for you)\n[[File:ACOD Brewing Love 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra agreed to help Melanippos]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can find her for you.

What is it?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''A herb hot enough to ''impassion'' him.

I moved to Thebes with dreams of becoming a great champion. I came to this gym and saw him... A mighty warrior with an even mightier smile. I wanted to learn from the best, but the only muscle he truly worked on was my heart.''\n(If players choose \"Why do you love Drakon?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're going to a lot of effort for Drakon.

The only time he leaves is to perform at the [[Drakon's Training Site|training ground]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll go find the herbalist\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go find that herb for you.''\nKassandra left the gymnasium and traveled to the [[Scorched Rolling Plains]] to find the herbalist. She spotted a farmhouse and beside it a silo that had a red cloth on it with the help of [[Ikaros]]. \n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the place.''\nWhen she arrived at the farm she found a farmer surrounded by bandits.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Don't. Don't.''\n*'''Archer:''' ''Then get her out of the house. You die if she doesn't.<br>The farm is'' ours.\nKassandra fought the bandits and defeated them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bandits! What a surprise...''\nKassandra freed the farmer who had been tied up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're gone, you can come out now.''\n[[File:ACOD - Boeotian herbalist.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra meeting the herbalist]]\nThe herbalist opened the farmhouse door which had been barred against the bandits.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''. If you hadn't intervened we'd surely be dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They must have really wanted something from you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''The farm. It's one of the few untouched by the war. Herbs aren't free, you know. They'd uproot 'em and sell 'em.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Speaking of herbs, that's why I'm here. I need to buy one for a man named Melanippos. Says he knows you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''That troublemaker still wants to make the love potion?''\nThe herbalist turned around and closed the door to the house.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Well, he'll have it his way. I can sell you the herb he needs.''\n<tabber>\n|-|But I saved you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I saved your farm.

It better be worth all the trouble.''\n[[File:ACOD - Melanippos celebrating.png|thumb|250px|Melanippos rejoicing]]\nMelanippos was delighted and begun to sing.\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Yes, yes. Drakon is mine 'til the end of time. Maybe I'll take him for a moonlit walk at the [[Site of Iphigenia's Sacrifice]]... He won't have to go far from his training site.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And his armor?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''It waits patiently for the potion in my house.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. Be sure you take your time with it... for the potion to work best.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra obtained the herbs [[Melanippos]] required to make his love potion. Melanippos stole [[Drakon]]'s armor to apply the potion and Drakon was weakened when he and Kassandra finally met.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*This quest is missable: finishing [[The End of Drakon]] removes the quest.\n*It is possible to avoid paying the herbalist for the herbs by killing her and looting them from her corpse.\n**Alternatively, saving her husband, walking away from the first offer and returning reduces her asking price by half.\n*Completing this quest strips Drakon of his armor, making him more vulnerable in a fight if not allowing for a one-hit assassination.",

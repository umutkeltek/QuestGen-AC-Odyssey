You came all this way, and I've been nothing but cruel.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, you weren't the first, and you won't be the last.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Delians are kind people. At least we were. Before...

Swords in their hands and food in their bellies. Take them away, and the guards fall.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Scouts reported Podarkes's supplies and weapons were stockpiled in the [[Kynthos Ruins|old ruins]] on Delos Island.''\n(If the supplies were already destroyed)\nKassandra laughed.\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''In the ruins on Delos?

And, did you make Podarkes feel our sting?''\n\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll destroy Podarkes's supplies.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go to Delos, find their stockpiles, and destroy them.''\n\nKassandra set sail for Delos to track down Podarkes's supplies. She found them at the Kynthos Ruins at the northern part of the island.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Kynthos Ruins. This is where I'll find Podarkes's weapons and supplies.''\n[[File:ACOD Kyra with a Cause 6.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding a supply crate]]\nShe spotted supply crates scattered around the ruins and set fire to them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A supply crate.

Don't mind if I do.''<br />\u00a0\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Podarkes thought he was clever hiding weapons on Delos.''<br />\u00a0\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This should cripple Podarkes' defenses.''<br />\u00a0\nUpon destroying enough supply crates and weapon racks, Kassandra considered her task complete.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That should do it. Kyra will want to hear about this.''\nBefore leaving, she explored the nearby [[Tomb of Brizo]] and found a stash of good Athenian Wine.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Athenian wine. I'm sure Kyra would enjoy this. Come to think of it, so would I.''\nHaving successfully destroyed the supplies, Kassandra returned to Kyra. The rebel leader called out to her.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Kassandra! You've returned in one piece!''\nKassandra delivered her report.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''And? Is it done?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Podarkes' guards will have to fight with their fists and on empty stomachs from now on.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Excellent!''\n\n(If players found the wine)\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Let's talk about what's next.=\n(Dialogue continues below)\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I found wine.

And to think I nearly threw my blade through your neck.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No one's perfect.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, what will you do once Podarkes is dead and the rebellion is won?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''The sad truth is I have no idea. For as long as I can remember, every day has been a struggle. To live, to laugh...''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Vengeance has all but consumed me.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''And what will Kassandra do one this is over?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Fulfill my destiny.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your destiny is to free the people of Delos.

You've had to fight and claw for everything you have. I know... because I've done the same.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''We're survivors. I'm glad the gods brought you to our shores, Kassandra. Some time alone would be nice. You must have many tales.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWe are both killers.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've seen you with a blade.

My dreams are of peace, ''misthios.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI wasn't expecting you to ask.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I just... We... I just thought that's what people said to each other. I wasn't expecting a follow up.''\nKyra laughed.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''The mighty Kassandra, caught off her guard!''\nKassandra rubbed her neck.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Relax. A moment together would be nice.''\n}}\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's time we got going. When Podarkes learns of what happened on Delos, he'll want revenge.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''And the first to suffer will be the Delians.''\nKyra walked off.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire''.''\nKyra held up her hand as though to wave goodbye back at Kassandra.",

    "Section_Trivia": "*The quest name may be a reference to ''Rebel Without a Cause (1955)'', given Kyra's position, although the context of \"rebel\" in the film differs from that of Kyra's rebellion.\n*Ther is a possible bug where if you complete the Kynthos Ruins before speaking to Kyra to start this quest, it is possible for the Athenian Wine to not spawn in the [[Tomb of Brizo]].  Saving and reloading near the Tomb once this quest becomes available but before speaking to Kyra can fix this bug.",

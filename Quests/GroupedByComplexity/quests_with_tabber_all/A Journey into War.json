If it's not [[Sparta]]ns or [[Athens|Athenians]], it's bandits and pirates. [[Greek mythology|Gods]] protect us all from [[Human|mankind]].''\nBarnabas saw three Athenian [[ship]]s blocking their way to the shores of Megaris.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''The Athenians have blocked the entrance to the bay!''\nKassandra and her crew destroyed the trio of ships that made up the blockade.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You did it. We're through! From what I've heard, Megaris is home to the fiercest fighting so far. The Spartans are preparing for a final push to rid the region of Athenians.''\nArriving at Megaris, they came upon the aftermath of a battle that had just occurred on the beachhead.\n*'''[[Stentor]]:''' ''The [[Wolf]] takes no prisoners!''\nAfter thwarting an attack from the Athenians, Nikolaos addressed his gathered troops.\n[[File:A Journey into War - Nikolaos and Stentor - Assassins Creed Odyssey.png|thumb|250px|Nikolaos addresting the Spartans]]\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''See how the Athenian [[dog]] [[Perikles]] fears you! He cowers in his [[Parthenon]], surrounded by playwrights and sophists. He dares not face you with honor on the battlefield. He knows you are too strong. He knows Athens' days in Megaris are numbered. And he knows Athens is next!''\nAt the culmination of his speech, Kassandra stepped onto the beach and walked toward him, only to be stopped by Stentor.\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You. You destroyed the Athenian blockade?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They were in my way.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Sparta owes you thanks. [[Tyche]] has blessed you, my friend. You arrived in time to watch my ''pater'' achieve a glorious victory.''\n<tabber>\n|-|So, you're my brother.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If Nikolaos is your father, I guess that makes you my brother.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Did you take a blow to the head during battle? What are you talking about?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Wolf is my father as well as yours.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Ridiculous! Before he adopted me into his home he had [[Alexios|two]] children, and they both died in Sparta many years ago.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Except for the one standing before you now.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You almost fooled me, but I wasn't born yesterday, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. Let's stick to the subject of why you're here.''\n|-|Nikolaos's children died.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't be his son. I heard his children died in Sparta many years ago.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''He adopted me into his household after his previous family failed him. I would never bring dishonor to him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sometimes things happen in a way that you don't plan or expect. History has a way of remembering things strangely.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You talk as if you were there.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe I was.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Nonsense. You're too young to have witnessed such things. But enough of the past, let's discuss the future.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Stentor:''' ''What is a mercenary doing sailing into a war they aren't being paid to fight in? Tell me why you're really here before I cut you down for wasting my time.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I was just passing through.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was just passing through and smelled opportunity on the breeze.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''The only thing I smell is lies. You're a sell-sword. The only thing you're here for is to try and kill the Wolf like all the rest. Maybe you should have kept sailing past.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I saw fellow Spartans in trouble and thought you could use the help of a well-armed mercenary.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''We are Spartans. We do not need anything from the likes of you, but my father taught me to use every resource at my disposal. I could make use of you.''\n|-|I've come to meet the Wolf.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've come to meet the Wolf of Sparta.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You cannot simply meet with Nikolaos. He has command of the entire [[Spartan army]]. If you truly came all this way to meet him, you might be disappointed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you sure you're in charge here? You don't strike me as a typical Spartan. Perhaps it's best I just talk with Nikolaos.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''A sense of humor is not a trait I see being useful for a sell-sword. If you're here to earn [[drachma]]e though, I could make use of a capable mercenary.''\n|-|I've come to pledge my sword.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It\u2019s my honor to serve Sparta. I've come to pledge my [[sword]] to the Wolf of Sparta.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''If you wish to pledge your services to my ''pater'', you can do so by helping me.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Stentor:''' ''The fleet might be destroyed, but Megaris is firmly in Athenian control. We need to weaken their position if we are to take to the field and drive them back to Athens.''\n(If \"What can you tell me about your father?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your father. Who is he exactly?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Nikolaos, the Wolf of Sparta. He was impressed with my skill when I was a boy and took me under his wing. He trained me himself and eventually adopted me into his house. He is my father and mentor. I live to make him proud. Surely you've heard of him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just rumors really.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I doubt they do him justice. He is a great warrior and a greater general. I'd follow him to the [[Path to the Underworld|gates]] of the [[underworld]].''\n(If \"What's the state of the war?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How goes the war effort?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''The Athenian blockade was a desperate attempt to stop our advance through Megaris. Now, we can prepare to drive them from this region once and for all. Our forward scouts are identifying key targets in preparation for our assault. Under the Wolf's command, we shall be victorious.''\n(If \"Tell me why you need a mercenary.\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why do you need a mercenary to do that? You seem to have plenty of [[soldier]]s at your disposal.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''It's not a question of manpower. The Megarians are our allies. We do not want to commit troops until we know victory is assured. My scouts are already locating key targets that we can hit.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm ready to serve.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready to serve. Together we will ensure that Sparta is victorious.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You're a different kind of ''misthios'', aren't you? You're just what we need to help deal with that meddling Athenian mercenary.''\n|-|I'll help for a price.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you rid Megaris for a price.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Typical of your type. No honor or sense of duty, but your skills are better serving us than our enemy. The Athenians already have a mercenary working for them, they don't need more help.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD A Journey into War Screenshot 07.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra conversing with Stentor about helping the Spartans]]\n*'''Stentor:''' ''If we can draw the leader out and eliminate him, we will crush the Athenians on the battlefield and drive their forces all the way back to Athens. Destroying their supplies, stealing their [[Treasure chest|war chest]], and killing their elite troops should leave him vulnerable.''\nStentor quickly tossed his [[Trade Goods|personal seal]] to Kassandra.\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Take this and present it to my scouts. If you find them in the field be sure to check for new information. They might also have need of your skills.''\n(If \"Where's the Athenian leader?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is the Athenian leader?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''He is in Megaris, hiding behind stone walls and a full garrison of troops. But if you kill his troops, destroy his supplies, and steal his riches, then he'll be open to attack.''\n(If players choose \"What supplies should I destroy?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What supplies should I destroy?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Anything the Athenians need. Look for crates of supplies, and weapons. The [[Port of Nisaia]] in the [[Valley of King Lelex|Valley]] of King [[Lelex]] would be a good place to start. It's where their supplies come into the region.''\n(If \"Which chests need stealing?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This chest you want me to steal, why is it so important?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''An army is made of men that need paying. Take away their drachmae and they lose all the will to die for other men's ambitions. The Athenians keep their treasure well guarded in the fort at the foot of [[Mount Geraneia]].''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I know what I must do.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think I know what must be done.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Remember, every Athenian soldier you eliminate will also help us achieve victory.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And once I've brought the Athenians to their knees for Sparta, I'll get that meeting with Nikolaos. Or you'll be next.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Send those Athenian dogs to [[Hades]], ''misthios''. Do this and the Wolf will personally see to it that you are rewarded.''\nKassandra departed the shore, heading inland to further her mission.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I want to get closer to the Wolf, I'll have to help Stentor defeat the Athenians. I shouldn't waste any time.''",

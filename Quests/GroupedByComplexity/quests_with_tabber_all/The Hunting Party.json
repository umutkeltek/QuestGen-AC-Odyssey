    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled through the city of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and overheard Hippokrates talking to a man north of the [[Akropolis of Thebes]], while a line of patients awaited treatment. The man bore grave news.\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''What?! When did this happen?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Earlier today. I was taking my boy fishing when we heard the screams.''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''What were they doing out there?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Hunting party, I think.''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''We must send aid at once.''\nKassandra approached him.\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''Thank the [[Twelve Gods|gods]] you're here. A hunting party has been attacked outside the city, near the [[Cursed Land of Oedipous]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any survivors?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''This man saw dead bodies, but he could still hear screaming.''\n<tabber>\nThey must be saved.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There are many dangerous beasts out in the wild. If someone is injured, they won't last long.''\n|-|They should be better hunters.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If they weren't ready to face the beasts out in the wild, they shouldn't have gone hunting. Nature is not kind to those who underestimate her.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''I need you to go and rescue whoever is still alive, and put an end to the dangerous beast that attacked them.''\n<tabber>\nAccept - I'll save the survivors.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll destroy the beast and [sic] if anyone's still in one piece.''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''If they are, bring them back to me, and I'll do what I can to save them.''\n|-|Leave - I don't think so.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not interested in saving foolish hunters right now.''\nKassandra returns.\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''There's no time to waste. We must help those in danger.''\n(Back to dialogue choice one.)\n</tabber>\n(If players asked \"Where did the attack happen?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There are a lot of hunting grounds nearby. Where should I look?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''They were sighted following animal tracks around [[Snake Head Rock]].''\n(If players asked \"What kind of creature was it?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know what attacked them?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''Not for certain. The roar could have been from any number of beasts... Many predators call the wilds of Boeotia their home.''\n(If players asked \"How many survivors are there?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How many people will I find out there?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''It sounded like only one hunter was alive, but hunting parties usually contain three or four people.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll find the wounded.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go and find the trail.''\nKassandra travelled to the road below Snake Head Rock. [[Ikaros]] helped her find its adjacent cave, where the bodies of the hunting party could be seen, as well as a lone man being mauled by a brown bear and a large albino bear.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Must be what's left of the hunting party.''\nKassandra drew closer as the man, [[Galeos]], begged for salvation from his predators.\n*'''Galeos:''' ''Please, by all the gods, save me.''\nKassandra leapt into the fray and attacked the bears.\n*'''Galeos:''' ''Quickly! Kill that beast before it finishes me off.''\nKassandra managed to eliminate the bears. Galeos was severely injured, so she carried him and rested him on the saddle of [[Phobos (horse)|Phobos]].\n*'''Galeos:''' ''Thank you. Thank you. I owe you my life, brave hero.''\nShe rode Phobos back to Thebes with Galeos losing blood.\n*'''Galeos:''' ''I feel faint. I'm getting dizzy.''\nKassandra mused on his condition.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get him back to Hippokrates before he bleeds out all over me.''\nDespite his condition, Kassandra successfully delivered him to Hippokrates' clinic, where she laid him down in a wooden bed on the ground to receive treatment.",

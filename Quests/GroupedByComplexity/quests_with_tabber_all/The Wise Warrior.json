That's half true. They have a base sort of cunning. It shouldn't be enough to withstand Athenian might. Assuming the other generals make intelligent decisions instead of stalling.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You do know I'm of Spartan birth?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''You're more skilled than the average Spartan. In time, you might even manage Athenian citizenship.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The true pinnacle of success.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Of course. I wish I had more say over our naval forces. What I could do to the Spartans then...''\n(If \"How long have you been a general?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you held this command for long?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I've been a general in the army for a long time. I made some mistakes in my early days, but I more than made up for them after. Still, everyone attributes my victories to luck. Never to my own decisions.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see how that could be frustrating.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Other men take credit for my victories. Cautious men who cause needless deaths by overlooking opportunities. You know what happens to a General who loses his reputation? Who gets blamed for the loss of Athenian lives?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing good.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''He dies. So I will do everything to preserve Athenian lives. Maybe one day, I'll even get credit for my accomplishments.''\n(If \"Why do you need the seals?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why do you need these seals?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I need those seals to shove in the faces of the assembled generals, to get them to wake up. While they've been debating and stalling, I've been winning the war.''\n(\"Leave \u2013 I have what I need.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know what I have to do.''\n(If the seals have already been acquired.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Actually, I already have them. I may have killed a few more Spartan commanders than you'd mentioned.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''An overachiever. Maybe you are as good as they say. Would you be interested in more work?''\nKassandra returned to the general after finishing her task.\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Do you have the seals for me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''More seals, and more proof what we're doing is working. Thankfully, there are at least some people in power willing to listen to me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll leave the politics to you.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''As it should be.

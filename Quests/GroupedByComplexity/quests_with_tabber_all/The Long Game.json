She walked to the center towards the preparation table and examined the mixture of food.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This food smells strange, but it's not rotten.''\nKassandra looked around and saw wine jugs sitting atop a storage chest and immediately deduced their contents.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This proves it, poison! It must have been added to the food and wine.''\nShe then entered the empty larder room and read the banquet supply list left in the corner.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm, a supply list for the celebration... and the merchant's name.<br />Time to pay this [[Priam]] a visit.''\nIn a stoa near the entrance and the [[Stables of Olympia|stables]], Kassandra met the merchant in his [[Priam's shop|shop]], but she was ambushed by a [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]] guard before she could confront him. She killed the ambusher and returned her attention to Priam, cracking her knuckles.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now we're going to have a conversation.''\nHe cowered in fear.\n*'''Priam:''' ''Please, please, I was just doing what I was told.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm your boss now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now you'll do what ''I'' tell you.''\nKassandra grabbed him by the throat.\n*'''Priam:''' ''Please, I thought we were just trying to make them slow\u2014you know, so they lose.

She infiltrated Fort Koroibos, wherein she located the antidote.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the antidote.''\nBack at the Sanctuary, she found Alkibiades and Barnabas in the [[Olympic Clinic|clinic]] near Leonidaion. Alkibiades rested on one of the beds.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, I have the antidote.''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Long_Game_-_Alkibiades_drinking_antidote.png|thumb|250px|Alkibiades drinking the antidote]]\nBarnabas took the antidote and handed it to Alkibiades, who sat up to drink.

He addressed Kassandra.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Didn't you have one last fight in the pankration?''\nShe agreed and turned her gaze to Alkibiades.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go.''\nAlkibiades stood up and followed them out.",

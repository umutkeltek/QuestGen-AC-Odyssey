    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra met with [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]] at the hemicycle looking out towards the [[Mortal Encampment]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You look concerned.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''I'm worried about [[Persephone]].''\n<tabber>\n|-|Lie \u2013 Don't worry about Persephone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Persephone can look after herself.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''She's incredible, I agree, but these are strange times. I've heard that some ungrateful delinquents plot against her.''\n|-|People want her gone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I haven't been here long, but I've already heard people want her overthrown.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''You have? What do these humans expect from her? I'd heard some of the more ungrateful delinquents are planning to rise up. Imagine!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These \"ungrateful delinquents\"... could they be right?''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Pah! You give them too much credit. Still, Persephone needs protection.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't look at me.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''There's a friend of mine and your father's, [[Kyros of Zarax]]. He's a strong and honorable warrior. He's been abducted, but if we could free him...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're suggesting we make a human Persephone's bodyguard?''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''With Kyros at the ready, the humans will think twice before attacking one of their own.''\n(Asked \"Why are you devoted to Persephone?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were in love with Persephone.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''No one understands here the way I do. [[Adonis]] sees a cruel despot. To her [[Hades|husband]], she's a trinket on his arm.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what do you see?''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Me? Oh! I don't know\u2014I've never had anyone ask me before. She's... everything.''\n(Asked \"How did you meet Kyros?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How do you know this Kyros?''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''He was an aid, of sorts, to your [[Pythagoras|father]]. Every great painter needs a hand to crush their pigment. That was Kyros. A warrior.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll save Kyros.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Say no more. I'll find Kyros for you.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''I knew I could trust you. While you're gone, I'll arrange a meeting with Persephone. Bring Kyros to the heart of Elysium. We'll be there.''\nKassandra infiltrated the Human Encampment and released Kyros from his confinement. He recognized her [[Staff of Hermes Trismegistus|staff]] at once.\n*'''Kyros:''' ''You have the Staff?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyros of Zarax, Hermes sent me.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''That key maker is predictable. I'll give him that much.''\nKassandra escorted Kyros out of the camp.\n*'''Kyros:''' ''So, how'd you get that Staff?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pythagoras was my father. Things happened. Now it's mine.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''That right? That makes us family. I knew the man well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I heard. This way. Persephone's waiting.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Persephone herself? This is going to be easier than I thought.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait... ''What's'' going to be easier?''\nKassandra brought him to a crossroads, but stopped to inquire further.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, Kyros, let's make this quick. You said this is going to be easier than you thought.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Since we're basically family, I'm trusting your honor. I work for Adonis.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But you were caged by humans.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Yes, and Hermes \"found out\" about it, right around the time Persephone was coaxed into deciding she needs a bodyguard.''\n<tabber>\n|-|That's clever.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You staged the whole thing and you're using Hermes to infiltrate Persephone's lair? You're no simple warrior.''\n|-|You're a liar.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You talk about honor? You set up this lie and used me as a ''mule'' to infiltrate Persephone's lair. I expected to meet a warrior.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Before I met your father, I had four sons. Each a \"warrior.\" When my third boy fell in battle, there was only guilt. I'd cried all my tears for the first two.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go on.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''And with the fourth, I felt longing\u2014sadness had become my only friend, and I had no one left to grieve. Warriors don't bring peace. They bring sorrow.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So by getting behind Persephone's defenses, you think you can prevent war. You could convince her to surrender or distract her while Adonis escapes.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Anything but battle. But before we go to Persephone, I have to send confirmation this plan worked. Will you take me?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 I'll take you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine, but be quick. We need to go to Persephone and Hermes. They're waiting.''\nKassandra escorted Kyros to his dead drop.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You really think you can save lives?''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''I'm not sure how death works in Elysium, but suffering is eternal, and that ''is'' something I can stop.''\nWhen they reached the drop-off location, they found mind-controlled Isu soldiers stationed there.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're coming for you!''\nKassandra killed the soldiers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all of them. Let's keep moving.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Once Adonis hears my plan worked, maybe he'll stand down.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hurry, Kyros. We need to get back to Hermes, or Persephone might suspect something.''\nKyros secured his message to Adonis.\n*'''Kyros:''' ''I hear Persephone likes to test her new recruits, and I've got a bit of a temper. If you see me turning red...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll think of something.''\nKassandra brought Kyros to the [[Heart of Elysium]], where Hermes waited.\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Where've you been? No one keeps Persephone waiting.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nLie \u2013 We took the long way.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It got complicated. We took a less direct route.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''What matters, Hermes, is I'm freed thanks to you. When I go to my queen, I will make sure she's grateful to ''you'' for my service.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nKyros had to do something first.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyros delayed us. Ask him.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''I... I'd been locked up for ages. You know how our queen feels about filth. I didn't want her judging us, judging ''you'', for being unpresentable.''\n}}\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Explain it to Persephone. She's waiting.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''I'll make sure she knows this was entirely my fault, not yours.''\nKyros took his leave.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nHigh Influence=\nHermes shrugged.\n*'''Hermes:''' ''I'm sorry I was ungrateful. Kyros will make a strong guard. Thank you again, friend.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire'', Hermes.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLow Influence=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It didn't go as you planned, but relax. Persephone's safe.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''I am grateful for the effort, my friend, but she's not. The delinquents are getting bolder. While you were gone, I was robbed.''\n(dialogue continues in the [[The Keeper and the Flame|following memory]] from Kassandra: \"What did they take?\")\n}}\n|-|No, Persephone's waiting.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've already wasted too much time talking, Kyros. We have to go.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''You're as stubborn as your father. Still, you mustn't say anything to Persephone. If she knew what we were doing, she'd have my head.''\nThey mounted horses and traveled immediately to the Heart of Elysium.\n*'''Kyros:''' ''I hear Persephone likes to test her new recruits, and I've got a bit of a temper. If you see me turning red...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll think of something.''\nAt the Heart of Elysium, Hermes greeted them enthusiastically.\n*'''Hermes:''' ''You've come back, and just in time!''\nAs Kassandra and Kyros presented themselves to Hermes, [[Ros]] walked up behind them and sat, getting their attention. They turned to witness Persephone stride forward.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Kyros of Zarax. Tell me\u2014are you the obedient dog Hermes claims you are? I do ''love'' dogs.''\nKyros turned cross at her remark, then glanced quickly at Kassandra. Persephone continued to prod him.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Does he not speak?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He speaks. Kyros, take a deep breath and speak.''\n*'''Kyros:''' ''Apologies, my queen. To hear of your beauty is one thing, but to see it up close is another.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Beautiful, am I?''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Pah! Among other things.''\nKyros turned to shake hands with Kassandra.\n*'''Kyros:''' Chaire'', Child of Pythagoras. If he were here, he'd be proud of what you've become.''\nKyros bowed to Persephone, and she strode forward to stroke Hermes on the cheek.\n*'''Hermes:''' ''My queen.''\nShe nodded to Kyros to lead him and Ros out of the garden, leaving Kassandra and Hermes to talk alone. Hermes held his cheek.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nHigh Influence=\n*'''Hermes:''' ''She... touched me!''\nHermes turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Kyros is right, my friend. I knew your father well. If he were here, he'd be proud. ''Chaire.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLow Influence=\n*'''Hermes:''' ''She... touched me. Focus, Hermes.''\nHermes turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Hermes:''' ''There's been a development. It's these delinquents. They've robbed me!''\n(dialogue continues in the [[The Keeper and the Flame|following memory]] from Kassandra: \"What did they take?\")\n}}\n</tabber>",

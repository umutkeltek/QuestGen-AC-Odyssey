It's a pleasure to meet you...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra. Tell me about the Battle.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Drakios:''' ''The Battle of One Hundred Hands draws warriors from all corners of the [[Greece|Greek]] world to compete for a large purse. But as competitions go, it's also very deadly\u2014a last person standing type of affair.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm good at deadly.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing is how I make my [[drachma]]e. This battle will be no different.''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''It's true. You have the look of a mythical hero about you...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I expect future generations to sing songs in my honor.''\n|-|I'm a simple misthios.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do my best work in the shadows.

And because the Battle is backed by the most powerful and influential people in the Greek world, the purse is always growing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you mean the people I think you mean, then I would like to meet them and... have a few ''words.\n*'''Drakios:''' ''Indeed. They are the kind of people I would never speak about openly.<br>You know, you do look like someone I've met before, another fierce warrior. Family resemblance, perhaps?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean [[Deimos]]? Then this Battle is backed by the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]].''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''Of course I can't talk about that. Not with any old challenger. But become the Champion of the Battle of One Hundred Hands, and I'll tell you all I know.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll take part in the Battle.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want to fight in the Battle.''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''I thought you might.

She was going to be my top recommendation as she's amongst our highest-ranked contenders. If you can train with her, then there is certainly a place for you in the Battle.''\n|-|If Roxana not met.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you can direct me to a worthy training partner.''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''Indeed, indeed. One of our top-ranked competitors is looking for a training companion. Roxana. She spars on [[Hydrea]], the island just north of here.''\n</tabber>\n(If players choose \"How did this tradition begin?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What started the tradition of a free-for-all battle on Melos?''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''I started it with some financial support from the powerful people I mentioned. The metaphor is that each combatant is battling a'' [[Hekatonchires|Hecatoncheir]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The creature with fifty heads and one hundred hands.''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''Indeed. By defeating all the competitors, it's as if the Champion has slain the creature itself - quite an achievement. Not something to be attempted by the weak.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Indeed.''\n(If players choose \"What can you tell me about Roxana?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you know about Roxana?''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''She's from a long line of aspiring champions. Indeed, virtually her entire family has tried to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Aspiring ''champions.''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''None of them were as skilled as Roxana, it must be said.''\n(If players choose \"How did you get involved in the Battle?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How did you become the person who organizes the Battle?''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''I was an up-and-coming [[merchant]] in these parts... Down on my luck, it turned out. Owed a few favors, then some powerful people called in those favors. Turned out to be good for me. Blood sports are big business on Melos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These powerful people you mentioned. They're the Cult of Kosmos, aren't they?''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''The mysterious ones. You want to meet them. I know, but it will have to wait.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How long?''\n*'''Drakios:''' ''I stay close with all of my champions. If you win the Battle, it's something we can discuss over victory wine.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'm ready to battle.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready to compete.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Roxana-questchain complete.=\n*'''Drakios:''' ''Indeed.

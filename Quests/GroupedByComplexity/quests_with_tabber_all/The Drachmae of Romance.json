I should break your neck for this.''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''That's right. Show your true colors. You {{Wiki|Dorians}} are nothing but thugs.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''Why you {{Wiki|Ionians|Ionian}}...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Please, stay calm. Remember the truce!''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Kassandra please, if these fools break the truce...''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''Thief!''\n*'''Makar:''' ''You're one to talk, you double-dealing [[dog]].''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Stop it, or I'll stop you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you don't stop, I'll kill you both to preserve the truce.''\n|-|Calm down.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nobody wants trouble here\u2014you know what will happen to you both if you break the truce.''\n</tabber>\n\nThey both stopped silent.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now if someone can tell me what's going on...''\nThey went back to shouting at each other.\n*'''Makar:''' ''This dishonorable cur stole from me.''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''You call me a thief? You're the thief!''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Drachmae_of_Romance_-_Kassandra_interrupting.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra interrupting the two men]]\nKassandra interrupts them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough. I'll ask the questions.''\n(If players choose \"What's going on, Herodotos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Herodotos, what's all this about?''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''This scum robbed me!''\n*'''Makar:''' ''Scum! I'm from an honorable family. Only a lowly Ionian would steal.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I said'' Herodotos!\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Er, yes. It seems both their treasuries were breached, and their valuables stolen.''\n(If players choose \"Why are you accusing each other?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If there's been a theft, why do you suspect each other?''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''Because this...''\nHerodotos quickly interrupts.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It's a matter of blood. Makar is from an eminent Dorian line. Mighty warriors, but rather austere...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''While Lelex is from Ionian stock, a grand tradition of artists and philosophers\u2014''\n*'''Makar:''' ''You mean philanderers.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Both sides are important.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''Spoken like a true Ionian.''\n(If players choose \"You must honor the truce.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It seems unlikely they would rob each other at the same time.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''You have to find out who stole their [[drachma]]e. I can't believe they would do this to each other. Whatever their issues, they've always respected the Olympic truce.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll do it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find out what happened and protect the truce.''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''If you prove it's Makar, I will reward you well.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''As will I, if you bring me evidence of Lelex's double dealing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what if it's neither of you?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Then they will'' both ''reward you.''\nLelex and Makar looked at each other.\n*'''Lelex:''' ''Very well.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''Agreed.''\n|-|It's not my problem.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need to get involved in other people's family feuds.''\nKassandra returns.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Please, if the mystery of who robbed Lelex and Makar isn't solved, I fear there will be bloodshed.''\n(Back to dialogue choice one.)\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra left north of Olympia to the [[Treasuries, Olympia|Treasuries]]. She approached an open vault with a guard anxiously walking back and forth. She talked to him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did you see anything?''\nThe guard speaks nervously.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''No, nope, not'' nothing. ''Far less than'' anything.\nShe moves in closer.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you saw something.''\n[[File:ACOD Olympia - guard of treasuries.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra speaking to the guard]]\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Well, only if you count torches. But they crept up on me, they did. Must've been at least thirty of them.''\nKassandra replies sarcastically.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Torches crept up on you? If there were thirty of them, why isn't the ground stomped flat?''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Er... doeskin sandals, very soft. Don't leave a trace. Anyway, hard to tell how many, as I was unconscious.''\nShe glares at him.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Enough of your lies.=\nKassandra becomes assertive.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me the truth, or I'll beat it out of you. Are you the thief?''\nThe guard becomes scared.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''No, please. Look, it wasn't me. I fell asleep\u2014didn't see anything apart from the torches.''\n|-|That sounds like it hurt.=\nKassandra pretends to be friendly.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's all right if you ran. Fear can change a man.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''I wasn't afraid, I was asleep... Oh, I mean...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't tell, but did you see anything?''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''No... Except...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes?''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Some torches, heading east.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you didn't investigate?''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''I didn't want to leave my post.''\nShe is baffled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But you'd already been robbed!''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''If I deserted my post, I'd be charged with dereliction of duty.''\nKassandra shakes her head.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then I'll let you get back to work.''\nShe approaches the open vault and examines the doors.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These crypts have been opened. There's no sign of forced entry.''\nKassandra moves away and looks around, then she spots a tablet beside the vault on the ground in front of a tree and read it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm, a note. \"Take all that you can carry, and meet me at the ruins where we first consummated our love. Soon we will be free.\"''\nShe left the area and concludes to herself:\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've heard talk of [[Destroyed House of Oinomaos|ruins]] outside the city, and from what the guard said, the torches were heading in that direction.''\nKassandra called [[Phobos (horse)|Phobos]] and rode east of Olympia to an old, ruined house surrounded by rocky cliffs and slopes of the {{Wiki|Mount Erymanthos|mountain}}. She scouted with [[Ikaros]] and found them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found the thief.''\n[[File:ACOD Drachmae of Romance - thieves.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the thieves]]\nShe climbed to an opening underneath, then entered the next room where the thieves are. Both man and woman, talking and holding each other's hands, were unaware of Kassandra until she approached them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So,'' thieves, ''I finally catch you.''\nThe woman speaks apprehensively.\n*'''Laneira:''' ''Please, we're not thieves.''\nKassandra moves in closer and points at them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yet here you are with stolen goods.''\nThe man puts his hands up defensively.\n*'''Menon:''' ''You don't understand, this is rightfully ours. It's our inheritance.''\n(If players choose \"What do you mean, inheritance?\")\nKassandra briefly looks at the chest nearby.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How can this all be yours?''\n*'''Menon:''' ''It belongs to our families\u2014by blood it's rightfully ours.''\n(If players choose \"Why did you take it?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it's already yours, why not wait? Why steal everything now?''\n*'''Laneira:''' ''We wanted a new life. One where we could be free, and our love doesn't have to hide in the shadows.''\n(If players choose \"Tell me who you are.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who are you, exactly?''\nMakar and Lelex joins in.\n*'''Makar:''' ''They are my daughter and his son!''\nThe woman is surprised.\n*'''Laneira:''' Pater!\nLelex moves closer from behind, addressing his son who is also surprised.\n*'''Lelex:''' ''This is how you repay me for raising you? By running off with some woman squirted from my enemy's loins?!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Enough!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why not put aside your feud, as your children have done?''\n|-|You're stronger together.=\nKassandra remarks on the situation.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This robbery has brought you together. Lelex, Makar, you worked together to find out what happened to your drachmae.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''Actually, the guard told us.''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''And his family stole my money.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''As yours did mine.''\nKassandra briefly pinches the bridge of her nose.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But think how much you could achieve working together.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Makar:''' ''You're a'' [[mercenary|misthios]]. ''Carry out your duty and kill the thieves. I will pay you handsomely.''\n*'''Laneira:''' Pater, ''no!''\n*'''Lelex:''' ''I agree. I will match Makar's price on this. Do what you were hired to do.''\nBoth Laneira and Menon moved back a little. Kassandra asks the men in disbelief.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You would kill your own son and daughter?''\nMakar chuckled and asks Kassandra impatiently.\n*'''Makar:''' ''We have other children. Now, are you a'' misthios ''or not?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll kill you instead.=\nKassandra moves closer. They moved back, afraid.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will not slaughter innocents. Your families would stand a better chance for the future without the both of you.''\n[[File:ACOD Kassandra kills Makar and Lelex.png|thumb|250px|Lelex and Makar dead]]\nThey hurriedly looked for something to use as a weapon, but she dispatches them quickly. A moment later, she sheathes her weapons and appear to mull over their deaths.\n*'''Laneira:''' ''I didn't want it to come to this, but now we can forge a new future for our two families\u2014one built on love.''\nThe man and woman moved and hold each other close, looking at each other's eyes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wish you luck with that...''\n|-|A job is a job.=\nKassandra resigns.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A contract's a contract.''\nThe couple accepts their fate as Kassandra executes them. After a moment of silence:\n*'''Makar:''' ''Good, the matter is settled.''\nLelex appears remorseful.\n*'''Lelex:''' ''I wish [there] could have been another way.''\n*'''Makar:''' ''There wasn't.''\nKassandra clenches her fists while they look at their son and daughter's corpses for the final time.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This blood is on your hands, not mine. May the [[Twelve Gods|gods]] forgive me.''\nMakar nonchalantly gives Kassandra her reward.\n*'''Makar:''' ''The gods don't'' care ''what we do. Here, take your drachmae. It was well earned.''\nLelex stares at him while Kassandra turns back to receive it.\n</tabber>",

    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' ''Could be one of [[Stentor]]'s scouts. Looks like he's run into problems.''\nKassandra approached the Spartan soldier near a destroyed convoy.\n*'''[[Dolios]]:''' ''I'll gut every last [[Athens|Athenian]] responsible for this. Fucking cowards. Once they're dead, Stentor will know I'm worthy of fighting by his side.''\nKassandra spoke to the soldier.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happened here?''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''What business is it of yours, [[Mercenary|misthios]]? Do you know anything about this?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Be glad I don't.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I did, you'd already be dead.<br />But it's your lucky day, I'm here to help. Stentor sent me.''\nKassandra took out her badge.\n|-|I'm a friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a professional and a friend.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''What's that supposed to mean?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it had been me, I'd have been smart enough to try and hide the evidence.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Fair point. Whoever did this was brazen and foolish... Leaving it to be so easily discovered.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Or they wanted to send a message.''\nKassandra took out a badge.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stentor sent me. I'm here to help wherever I can.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Stentor sent you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sparta doesn't fully control [[Megaris]]... yet. It's easier for me to move freely in certain areas of Megaris than a Spartan.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''The Athenians have proven more resilient here than expected, but they will not stand...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''...Before Sparta, yes\u2014I've heard the speeches. But until that glorious day comes, we should find out what happened here.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Do you have any ideas?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not yet but I will.<br />I should get a closer look to figure out what happened here.''\n[[File:ACOD_Portion_Control_-_Spartan_Soldier_Bodies.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra investigating the bodies]]\nKassandra investigated the bodies covered in sheets.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These were professional soldiers, slaughtered to a man. I don't think [[bandit]]s could have done this...''\nKassandra investigated the destroyed supply carts.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The supplies are missing. They can't have gone far though... they didn't use the carts.''\nKassandra investigated some tracks near the cart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like they went this way into the forest.<br />I don't think I'll find anything else. I should report back.''\nKassandra returned to Dolios.\n*'''Dolios:''' ''So was it the Athenians?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found some fragments of green crystal...''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Bandits then! The mountains here are riddled with caves, and the war has made them brazen.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Here's what I know.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it was Athenians, they would have taken the carts as well as the supplies... And bandits, they wouldn't have stood a chance against trained Spartans.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''What are you saying?''\n|-|Here's what my gut says.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing about this adds up...''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''In what way?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no bodies, at least not any assailants. Athenians would have taken the carts and their dead, but bandits would have left their fallen in the dust.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Then who did it?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not sure. Whoever did this went into the forest... So I'll start by looking there.''\nKassandra headed into the forest. With [[Ikaros]]' help, she found a cave southwest of the [[Grave of Tereus]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There\u2019s food being cooked near here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There they are!''\n[[File:ACOD_Portion_Control_-_Kassandra_Finds_Villagers.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding a group of villagers]]\nKassandra entered the cave and found a group of villagers with a bunch of supplies.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is this a private gathering, or can anyone join?''\n*'''[[Neaera]]:''' ''Wha... What are y... Please, please just leave.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't look like murderers, was that the Spartans' mistake?''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''What? Wait! No, please you don't understand!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's to understand? It all seems perfectly clear.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Please, let me plead our case?''\n<tabber>\n|-|No more talking.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You are murderers and thieves, and deserve no better.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Please, no! You don't understand, it was a mercenary that killed the soldiers!''\nKassandra fought Neaera and the villagers.\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Please, no!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Mercenaries attacked the wagons, not us!''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''We were just hungry...''\nKassandra eliminated the villagers and returned to Dolios.\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Kassandra Did you find the ones responsible?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found your supplies with a bunch of hungry Megarians.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''And?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They won't trouble you again.''\n|-|Explain yourself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'd better tell me why I shouldn't just kill you and return the goods.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Please, I'll tell you anything you want to know.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nWho are you?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're the sorriest band of thieves I've ever seen.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''By the gods no! We're citizens of [[Megara]]. Please, show mercy. This war has already cost us dearly.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Like the mercy you showed those Spartan soldiers?''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''I, we... We just took some food. [[Hyrkanos the Cunning|Hyrkanos]] told us to take it, said he'd make it easy for us.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hyrkanos?''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Yes, the [[mercenary]]. He said he'd provide food, told us the Athenians would never let their people go hungry.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWhy risk the wrath of Sparta?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Explain yourselves! It's not wise to anger the Spartans.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Please, we're not thieves. This is our food, our crops. They took it, left us with nothing! Our children are starving...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you repay theft with murder? A fine lesson for your children.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Murder, no. Please, we never harmed anyone.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''A misthios told us where to find the food. Everyone was already dead!''\n}}\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough, I didn't come here for debate. It's too late for talk now. I came to find who's behind this crime against Sparta.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're going to die.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There is only one just punishment for your crime.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''It was our food to begin with!''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''We either die here by your hand, or slowly starve later...<br />If I'm to die, I would rather die fighting.''\nKassandra eliminated the villagers and returned to Dolios.\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Kassandra Did you find the ones responsible?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found your supplies with a bunch of hungry Megarians.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''And?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They won't trouble you again.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWe can settle this peacefully.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stand aside, you don't need to die today. I'm returning the supplies to the Spartans.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Then you will do so over our dead bodies!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't be stupid. Take some of the food, enough to get by. I'll say I killed you and claimed what was left. They will be satisfied.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''But the food, what of our families?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your families will not benefit from your death. Accept my offer and don't steal again. It won't be me who comes for you next time.''\n*'''Neaera:''' ''Yes, misthios... Thank you.<br />Hurry! Take what you can carry and go. Quick.''\nKassandra took the supplies and returned to Dolios.\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Kassandra Did you find the ones responsible?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found your supplies with a bunch of hungry Megarians.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''And?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You stole that food from them. They were starving.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''The supplies were essential for the war and ridding Megara of the Athenians.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hungry Megarians are the least of your worries, but there's something else. Have you heard of a mercenary called Hyrkanos?''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Hyrkanos... Yes, he is working for the Athenians, so the rumours go.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is all his doing.''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''These mercenaries are persistent, I'll give them that. You've done well here, but if you really want to help Sparta, I have a task for you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you have in mind?''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Hunt him down! Show him that no mercenary dog will interfere with Sparta's plans.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Since you have such a high opinion of mercenaries, why even send me?''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''I'm sorry... It's just this man Hyrkanos is like a thorn in our foot. He's a menace to all Spartans here. Please, will you help us?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do it. If he's this much trouble, I take it there's a sizeable reward?''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''Of course! Just think of how much he'll have on him with all the [[drachma]]e Athens have given him to thwart our plans.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I suppose you're right... Any idea where to start looking?''\n*'''Dolios:''' ''He could be anywhere. Most likely, he's nestled up close to the Athenians. We've sent out a couple of patrols, but they never returned, and we can't spare any more men at this time.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sometimes you're better sending a woman, anyway.''\n}}\n</tabber>",

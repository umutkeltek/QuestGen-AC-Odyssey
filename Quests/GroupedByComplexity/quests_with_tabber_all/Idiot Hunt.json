He was last seen west of Skandeia Harbor. Please hurry.''\n(If players asked \"How good a huntsman is he?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So he's an idiot\u2014but is he a good huntsman?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''He struggled with fish, ''misthios. Tiny, toothless fish.'' And now the fool is ''hunting lynx.\n(If players asked \"Where did he go?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said your husband headed\u2014''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''The biggest lynx live in [[Hunter's Cave|caves]] near the [[Mycenaean Ruins|ruins]].

Must be something in that cave.''\nEntering the cave, she heard someone.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''That... is a lot of blood!<br>Help! I can hear you!<br>Please, I\u2014there's so much blood, help!''\nKassandra found the hunter on the ground, injured.\n[[File:ACOD Idiot Hunt 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finds the husband heavily wounded]]\n(If Kassandra had not yet met the wife, she instead questioned the civilian about how he got there.)\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I knew you weren't a lynx. Heard you're footsteps. Only two. Lynx have four.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're seriously wounded.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''These lynx\u2014uh, they're a bit tougher than the sea bass I usually catch.

Even a lynx wouldn't touch 'em!<br>If you fancy yourself a ''hunter'', though... there's a [[Krokottas Hyena|monstrous beast]] in the south. Was gonna go after it myself once I broke in my bow.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Monstrous beast, huh? I'll have to see it for myself.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Let's get you home.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've lost a lot of blood.

I'm getting tired.''\nFortunately, Kassandra made it back to his wife with him still in one piece.\n\n(If players met the husband first)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you must be his wife.''\n**'''Civilian:''' ''The wife of an idiot, I'm afraid.''\n[[File:ACOD Idiot Hunt 6.png|thumb|250px|The husband reunited with his wife]]\nRegardless of who Kassandra spoke to first, she successfully reunited the husband and wife.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Missed your idiot?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''My love, you're alive!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''So. Are we having lynx for dinner?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Enough about the lynx.''\nThe couple embraced and shared a moment.\n<tabber>\n|-|You're a beautiful couple.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm happy to see you reunited.''\n|-|You're a crazy couple.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You are the strangest people I've ever met.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Love ''is'' strange, ''misthios''. Best to embrace it.''\n</tabber>\nThe two began to kiss each other passionately and noisily.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wonderful. I'll leave you to, ah\u2014''<br>Chaire.\nKassandra walked away with her reward.\n\nIf the man died.\n*'''Woman:''' ''What happened?!''\n<tabber>\n|-|I couldn't save him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found him in a cave, surrounded by lynx. He'd killed a few, but was too far gone to bring home.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''So my husband was alive when you found him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He was badly wounded - ''\n*'''Woman:''' ''But breathing? You - you could have helped him!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did all I could - ''\n|-|Lie - He's left you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found him in a cave not far from here. He was wounded, but alive.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I - what?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I stopped the bleeding and offered to bring him home, but he didn't want to come back.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Woman:''' ''Liar! How - you killed him! I'll send every mercenary in the [[Greece|Greek]] world after you!''\nTrue to her word, two mercenaries begun to hunt Kassandra.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped the woman to find and rescue her husband.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*If the quest is started by going to the cave first, the player can talk to the husband and ask him questions. During this questioning, he will mention a \"beast to the south\" that can only be the [[Krokottas Hyena]]. The protagonist will mention they should see this for themselves, even if the beast has already been encountered and slain.\n*If the cave is approached, but not explored and thus missing meeting the husband, the animals will kill him while you go and talk to the wife.",

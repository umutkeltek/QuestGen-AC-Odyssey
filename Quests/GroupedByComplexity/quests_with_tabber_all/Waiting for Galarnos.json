He was stabbed to death here on shore.''\nShe inspected the blood nearby and determined it trailed away from the beach.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm... a bloody trail. Someone was dragged towards the cliffs.''\nKassandra followed the blood trail, and Ikaros spied the entrance to the [[Seaside Cavern]] up the hill.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the place.''\nKassandra entered the cave and recognized the aesthetics of the [[Followers of Ares]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like the Followers of Ares.''\nKassandra infiltrated the depths of the cave and killed any Followers of Ares she came across, eventually finding the main chamber with the prison cages.

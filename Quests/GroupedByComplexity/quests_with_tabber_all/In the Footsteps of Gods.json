Surely you've heard this story since you were a child.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't have much time for stories.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Well. Perhaps you didn't.

Not thinking of becoming a soldier, are you?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Of course not. But think how many people will come to the shrine if we have the Spear of Kephalos! With their donations, I could do so many things! Repair the sanctuary. Feed the hungry families in [[Sami]].''\n(If players choose \"How can I find it?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where is the spear?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Apparently it's hidden deep in the caves beneath Kephallonia. There's an entrance north of here; maybe you can try that way first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not much to go on.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''You have so little faith in the gods! If Kephalos means for us to have the spear, you will find it!''\n(If players choose \"That's all for now.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what I can find.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Oh, thank you.

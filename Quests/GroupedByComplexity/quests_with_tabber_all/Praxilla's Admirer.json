Who is she?''\n*'''Orchimedes:\u00a0'''''Who\u00a0''is\u00a0''she? A poet blessed by [[Apollo]] himself! She describes the [[Greek mythology|gods]] as if they were her lovers. Her lyre is a legendary weapon, wielded in her hands. I want to meet her, but talking to a goddess such as she... terrifying.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Oh nonsense, usually you give a woman some flowers and she'll show you\u00a0her flower. However, this is Praxilla. She is not easily impressed.''\n*'''Orchimedes:''' ''Of course, no ordinary flower will do. They need to be worthy of a goddess.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I come to this coast every year for the poetry festival.

Praxilla should be in her tent.''\n(If \"What's the poetry festival?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mentioned being here for a poetry festival?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I did! It's one of the many festivals to Apollo, but this one holds a special place in my heart, among other places. Other festivals are so stuffy. Here, we worship like [[maenad]]s.''\n(Leave \u2013 I know enough.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've heard enough.''\n*'''Orchimedes:''' ''Please, if you are as skilled with [[sword]] and heart as Alkibiades says, you'll return to me with the Coral Rose. As a poet, it's best that I stay at camp while you do the hiking.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'd be an easy snack for [[Wolf|wolves]] or [[bear]]s. I'll return with the roses.''\nKassandra left to pick the roses, and soon found them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These must be the Coral Roses.''\nShe then returned to speak with Orchimedes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've found your Coral Roses.''\n*'''Orchimedes:''' ''You're back!

I'll take care of these commanders.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You're going straight for their throats.''\nHe paused for a moment.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Still... leave some Athenian blood for me.''\n[[File:ACOD The Thaletas Way 9.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Thaletas discuss the Athenian commanders]]\n(If players asked \"Where are the Athenian commanders?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to know where to find them.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Kyra's spies tracked all three of them.

One's camped [[Leleges Military Camp|nearby]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And the third?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Him, we don't know.''\n(If players asked \"What are their names?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want names, Thaletas.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''[[Tisandros]] commands the Athenian elite guard. [[Polemion]] is their strategist.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra punched a hole in the Athenian naval patrols, allowing Spartan reinforcements to slip through and land on Mykonos.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*The player can equip [[Thaletas' Helmet]] as a Rare-grade helmet, if it is found during this quest but withheld from him. The \"quest item\" version of the helmet can still be given to Thaletas at the end of [[Paint the Sand Red]], which removes it as a quest item in the player's inventory while retaining the wearable \"copy\" that the game generated for the player's use. The helmet can be very useful, given its default engraving of \"+% Chance to Ignore Half Damage.\"\n*The flirting dialog option \"So you like things rough.\" is not available if Kassandra lied to Thaletas and told him she's not Spartan when they first met during mission [[Trouble in Paradise]].",

As she approached Sokrates' fellow philosophers, she considered how they might help.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe I can convince them to stand up for Sokrates at the trial.''\nShe listened in on their conversation.\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''It's as [[Xenophanes]] said, of course! We have given the [[Greek mythology|gods]] [[human]] forms because we wish them to be as we are.''\n*'''Philosopher 2:''' ''No, they are as they are. Who are we to give form to the gods?''\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''Exactly my point! As he said, if [[Cattle|oxen]] or horses or any beast could produce art as we do, they would form the gods in the image of themselves.''\n*'''Philosopher 2:''' ''Yes, well they can't. And you've simply shown me again why Xenophanes is problematic.''\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''Come now, don't be like that. It's OK to be wrong... sometimes.''\n*'''Philosopher 2:''' ''Ha! I wouldn't know what that's like.''\n[[File:ACOD Persuasion Check 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra joining the conversation]]\nShe joined in on their conversation.\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''Do not students take what they learn from their teachers? What then if the teacher is wrong? Does that not simply perpetuate these wrong teachings among future generations?''\n*'''Philosopher 2:''' ''You assume the students aren't wise enough to understand the flaws of the teacher. Think of those who came before us. First [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]], then his student [[Anaximandros]], and then [[Anaximenes]]. Without the teachings of those before him, it's safe to say Anaximenes would not have reached the conclusions he did.''\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''I don't think that's true. Perhaps this new face can offer a different perspective.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I don't know who those people are.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've never heard the names you just mentioned.''\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''It's never too late to learn. But even so, one doesn't need to know who they are to answer. Is it not a risk that wrong ideas will be passed along if a student doesn't have the wisdom to seek the truth?''\n|-|I wasn't listening.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't hear a single thing you just said.''\n*'''Philosopher 1:''' ''Is that so? Well, let me simplify it quickly. Thales taught Anaximandros, who taught Anaximenes.

''Clearly you've taken on a teacher of your own.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Something like that. He's the reason I'm here. Sokrates needs your help.''\n*'''Philosopher 2:''' ''Sokrates? Ha!

Guess I should feel proud. I'm surprised to see a child here.''\n*'''Aristokles:''' ''Is there an age where it would suddenly be OK to debate with them? What then of the night before I turn that age?

I hope one day to be one as well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're on the right path. What's your name?''\n*'''Aristokles:''' ''Aristokles. Although, I've never liked that name much.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It does sound like countless others I've heard around Athens. Why not choose another?''\n*'''Aristokles:''' ''I can do that? Hmm... my brother always had a problem saying my name, so he called me Plato instead. Perhaps I'll use that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I like it.''\n*'''Aristokles:''' ''Thank you.

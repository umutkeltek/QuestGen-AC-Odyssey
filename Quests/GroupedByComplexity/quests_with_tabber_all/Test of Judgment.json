    "General_Description": "'''Test of Judgment''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "[[Kassandra]] was tasked by the mysterious woman to investigate the graveyard in [[Megara]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Mysterious Woman''' ''Misthios, may I trade your time for wealth? You look wiser than the average mercenary. Perhaps you're nearly as wise as Athena herself...''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You should watch what you say.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wiser and stronger. You might watch your tongue, auntie.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''You might watch yourself, Kassandra.''\n|-|That's refreshingly direct.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You speak plainly, auntie.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''I speak the truth, Kassandra.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know me?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Don't pretend to be ignorant of your infamy, Kassandra the Eagle Bearer. I have a series of tasks I thought someone of your reputation could handle. But if you feel you're not up to it...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What kind of tasks?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''To begin, I have a test of judgment. Which god is more dangerous, Poseidon or Apollo? The answer lies in a nearby tomb.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is just a riddle.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Riddles are telling. And rewarding, when I give them. Prove your worth to me by going to the graveyard near the Sanctuary of Athena and solving it.''\n\n(If the player chooses \"I can't help you right now.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't have time for riddles at the moment.''\n\n(If the player chooses \"I'll solve your dead man's riddle.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine, I'll figure out this riddle.''\n\nKassandra headed north to the graveyard of Megara. On arriving she read a large tombstone:\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Here lies my father, a simple farmer. A lion tore him to pieces as he brought in his grain. May the gods grant him peace.\"''\n\nShe also noticed a golden plate resting against the tombstone:\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A golden plate marked with the sun. An offering dedicated to Apollo and his youthful strength.''\n\nKassandra considered the memorial.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lions are a golden beast with manes like the sun. Surely they are the favorite of Apollo... Does that make him the more dangerous god?''\n\nKassandra considered a second memorial, and read the tombstone:\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Here lies my brother, a brave man. He was chosen to confront the enemy threatening our village. But his ship sank, and sharks feasted on his flesh. What little parts were found, I sealed in this tomb.\"''\n\nKassandra noticed an offering next to the tombstone:\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A model ship as an offering to Poseidon. Clearly someone feared death in the sea.''\n\nKassandra considered the second memorial.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sharks are under the command of Poseidon, as are all creatures of the sea. Is he the more dangerous god?''\n\nKassandra tried speaking with the Hermit, who replied simply:\n*'''Hermit:''' ''Whoooo.''\n\nFinding a small clay tablet resting on a tree, Kassandra read:\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Protect us from teeth that tear and beasts that bite.\" Sounds like a child's prayer.''\n\nBeginning to leave, Kassandra a furious man stepped in front of Kassandra and confronted her.\n*'''Dorykleidas:''' ''You! I know who you are. Athena sent you to kill me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would you think that?''\n*'''Dorykleidas:''' ''I was to be tried for murder, but a great fire burned up the court and all the records. I walked free! But lately I've heard Athena in my dreams, saying I would meet justice. And here you are.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You're right, I'm on a godly mission.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, I am the emissary of the gods. Cause me trouble, and I'll end your miserable life.''\n|-|No, I'm just fulfilling a contract.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''An old woman hired me to come here. You weren't part of that contract. But lose your temper and I might change my mind.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Dorykleidas:''' ''I know what Athena told me. I'll face my death blade-first!''\n\nThe man attacked Kassandra, who promptly killed him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've seen all there is to see here. Now to answer that woman's riddle.''\n\nKassandra headed south to return to the Port of Kechries and the Mysterious Woman.\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''You spent enough time in the graveyard. What did you find?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How did you know I actually went?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''I have my ways.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I think you're good at reading people.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is there dirt on my sandals? A look in my eye? It seems to me you're good at figuring people out.''\n|-|I think you have a divine gift.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It seems you may have a gift from Mount Olympos.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Perhaps. But I want to know which god you think is more dangerous, Poseidon or Apollo.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why are you so interested in knowing?''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Because I have two tasks that require the attention of a misthios, but I can trust the easier task to nearly anybody. I'm going to assign the more dangerous one to you, naturally.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Apollo and his lions are more dangerous.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There was a farmer attacked by a lion while he harvested his crops. An attack by a golden beast under the shining sun... Surely that is the work of Apollo, making him the more dangerous god.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Gold is a seductive danger in many ways... Yes, Apollo is a sensible choice.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad you agree.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''You've wisely considered the subject. I approve. Take this, it's for your judgment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You ask for my judgment, but you seem to be judging me.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Am I? Consider this. Lions don't usually eat farmers unprovoked.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you think something is pushing the lions to behave strangely.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''I'm sure you could find out what that is and help the locals with their lion problem. You'll find them in Argolis, east of the Hypermnestra Camp.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll pay them a visit.''\nKassandra continued her journey with [[Test of Faith]].\n|-|Athena is the most dangerous.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Both of those gods may be dangerous, but I met a man who claimed Athena sent me to kill him.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''How strange. If she could hear your words, I'm sure the goddess of justice would be amused.''\nKassandra's choices were then narrowed to Apollo and Poseidon.\n|-|Poseidon and his sharks are more dangerous.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There was a man torn to pieces by sharks on his way to confront pirates. That sounds like the punishment of Poseidon to those who would insult him.\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Defending a territory no man can invade with deadly force... Poseidon would indeed seem to be the greater danger.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad you agree.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''You've wisely considered the subject. I approve. Take this, it's for your judgment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You ask for my judgment, but you seem to be judging me.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''Am I? Consider this. A man took great risks to take to the sea. Perhaps you could figure out why.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''His tomb mentioned pirates. Perhaps they're still a danger.''\n*'''Mysterious Woman:''' ''I believe you should find his family in Megaris, south of the Ruined Temple of Apollo.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll pay them a visit.''\nKassandra continued her journey with [[Test of Character]].\n</tabber>",

    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's a little girl doing in a clay pit?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Ooh! A [[Mercenary|misthios]]!''\nThe girl stood up.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Hi, ''misthios''! I'm just preparing something for my friends.''\nKassandra looked around, confused.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''I've been here allllllllll day, but I still need more clay! I need enough for all of them.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That's very nice of you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What you're doing for your friends is very nice. I'm sure they'll appreciate it.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Really? You think so?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''I was thinking of getting them some other things though.''\n\n|-|Giving clay to your friends is weird.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your friends will be upset with you for giving them dirt.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Silly misthios! I'm not going to give this to them. I have other things in mind to give them.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a generous friend. What do you want to give them?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''I want to get them some nice goo-werry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean jewelry?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''That's what I said!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't look like you could afford any, honestly.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''I know! That's why I was going to get some shiny stones in the [[Abandoned Mines]] and a few pearls from the [[Polydektes Lagoon|lagoon]]. But I've been stuck here all day with the clay! And the Abandoned Mines are kinda scary... Do you think you could help me get some gifts for my friends? It'd make them happy, and that'd make me happy! I'll make some goo-werry for you too for helping him!''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll help you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gladly, young lady. I'll see to it you get the best pearls and shiny stones. And I wouldn't mind some \"joo-werry\" myself.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Yay! Thank you! You're really nice for a big, scary-looking person.''\n(If players asked \"Where can I find the pearls?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These pearls you talked about. Where can I find them?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''North of the claypits! In the lagooooooon! They're just sitting there in the water, but there are some biiiiig [[shark]]s in there. Be careful!''\n(If players asked \"Where is the Abandoned Mine?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where are these Abandoned Mines with your shiny stones?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''The mine is in the meadow! West of the [[Temple of Athena, Seriphos|temple]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what I can find.''\n(If players asked \"Where are these friends of yours?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where are all your friends?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''...They'll be coming soon. Just a little longer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Speak up, child, I can't hear you.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Never mind! I'll introduce you to them later!''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll see you later.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK, that's all I need to know. I'll see you later.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''I should be done here soon! Meet me at the cliff overlooking the lagoon, OK? I'll introduce you to my friends. Thanks, misthios!''\n\n[[Ikaros]] scouted out the entrances to the two places Kassandra needed to visit.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ah, the mines. That's where the shiny stones are.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's the lagoon with the pearls.''\n\nKassandra travelled to the Abandoned Mines.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Abandoned Mines with the shiny stones.''\nKassandra entered the mine, dealing with a few snakes and recovering several shiny stones.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These weren't too hard to find.''\n(Lagoon visited first)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've got the pearls and the shiny stones. I should return to the little girl.''\n\nKassandra headed to the Polydektes Lagoon.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is the lagoon the little girl mentioned.''\nKassandra dove into the lagoon, recovering several pearls.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's enough pearls.''\n(Mines visited first)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've got the pearls and the shiny stones. I should return to the little girl.''\n\nWith the pearls and shiny stones in hand, Kassandra headed to the cliff overlooking the lagoon. She found that the girl had reached the location.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The little girl and her friends. She got her sooner than I thought she would.''\nShe proceeded up the cliff and overheard the girl talking to someone.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Silly Theo! Don't put that in your hair! You look funny.''\n\nKassandra approached Khloe, who was making several clay sculptures.\n*'''Khloe:''' Misthios''! You made it just in time. My friends have finally arrived.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I... don't see anyone else here but us.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''What? Silly ''misthios'', can't you see them? They're right over there.''\nKhloe gestured to the clay sculptures she made.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''The one on the left is Theo, and the one on the right is Airla!''\n<tabber>\n|-|They look... nice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They look... friendly, but I don't think they really count as your friends.''\n|-|They're made of clay!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your friends?! They're made of clay! How can they be your friends?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Khloe:''' ''What do you mean? They're my friends. I made them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you made them, but that\u2014''\n*'''Khloe:''' Mater'' told me to make friends, misthios. A\u2014and I did.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This isn't the way to make friends. Tell your ''mater''\u2014''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''I can't. She's dead, misthios...''\nKassandra was stunned by this news.\n*'''Khloe:''' Mater'' is dead. She joined the pirates\u2014told me she'll bring back so much [[drachma]]e, we could swim in it! B-but one day, she came back, ''misthios''. Her favourite white robe was all red. And she told me\u2014To take care of myself and make more friends.'' \nKassandra was visibly saddened by Khloe's story, having been orphaned herself.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''But... I've never had any friends. I didn't know what she meant. So I thought really, reaaaaaaaally hard, and made my friends out of clay.''\nKhloe became concerned she did something wrong.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Did I make a mistake? ''Mater'' won't be upset at me right? I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!''\n<tabber>\n|-|No, you did great.=\n*'''Kassandra;''' ''No, child, no. You did great. Your mater would be proud of you. Friends come in all shapes and sizes. I have an [[Ikaros|eagle]], and he's a close friend of mine.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Wow, really? That's so cool...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here you go, your gifts for your friends, as promised. Why don't you go put them on for them? I'm sure they'll like that.''\nKassandra handed over the stones and pearls.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Thank you, misthios! You're the best! I'll go do that right now!''\nKhloe went to put the jewelry on the sculptures. Kassandra whispered to herself.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry, child. I could not break your heart, even if it was good for you.''\nKassandra walked away, but decided she should check on Khloe later.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should check in on her later...''\nIn time, Kassandra returned to check on Khloe. Khloe was crying over the rainswept remains of her clay friends.\n\n|-|Yes, this stops now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't do this anymore.''\nKassandra stood and cast the shiny stones and pearls into the lagoon.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''W-what are you doing? Those are for my friends!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They are ''not'' your friends! \"They\" are lumps of ''clay''!''\nKhloe began to cry. Kassandra raised her hand to her forehead, then kneeled to instruct her directly.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You need to make ''real'' friends. Go into the towns, find children your age. You cannot live out here alone.''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''But all the townsfolk told me to stay away... They say I'm a cursed girl.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then go somewhere else, find other people. There are still good people left\u2014''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''You just don't get it! You're not me! You don't understand...''\nKassandra stood, staring down at her as if to protest Khloe's statement.\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Go''away''!''\nKassandra walked away, but decided she should check on Khloe later.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should check in on her later...''\nIn time, Kassandra returned to check on Khloe. She was not alone; two small children were helping her work the rainswept clay. One admired a doll she made.\n*'''Child (1):''' ''Woooow! You made this doll on your own?''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Y-yes! I make them out of clay.''\n*'''Child (2):''' ''Can you make one for me, too?''\n*'''Child (1):''' ''Me too! Make one for me too! Then we can all play with them together!''\n*'''Khloe:''' ''Sure!''\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "If told the hard truth she will get angry at Kassandra at first but some other children run up to her to help her finish the clay statues. If spared the truth she will be happy at first, but after it had rained a part of her clay friends washed away, resulting in Khloe being unhappy and lonely again.",

    "Section_Description": "With their plans in motion, Kassandra met with Darius, Natakas, and Kleta in the makeshift hideout in Patrai to begin the final evacuation of the stranded.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra completed her preparations and decided to meet with Darius and the others for the next step.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should find Natakas.''\nKassandra drew near the ship hideout in [[Patrai]] and overheard Natakas sharing with Kleta the story of how he and his father [[Shadow of a Legend|first met]] Kassandra.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Father almost killed her when they first met. If I hadn't stopped them...''\nKleta laughed.\n*'''Kleta:''' ''Really? Who do you think would've won?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Um...''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I can handle myself.''\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 1.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra at the hideout with the group]]\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good, we're all here...''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''We've done everything we set out to.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now, to get the stranded people out of Achaia...''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''The [[Phila|Tempest]] is on her way to install the [[Chimera's Breath]] on the [[Skylla (ship)|Skylla]].''\n*'''Darius:''' ''But we have the Chimera's Breath now... The Tempest will never know what hit her.''\n<tabber>\n|-|The Tempest doesn't stand a chance.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Without the Chimera's Breath, she doesn't stand a chance. I am Poseidon's Chosen, after all.''\nDarius frowned and shook his head at her bad joke. Kleta did not understand the reference.\n*'''Kleta:''' ''What?''\n|-|I hope you're right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've done what we can to prepare.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Now we have to execute.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll surprise the Tempest. [[Barnabas]] and I will launch a sea attack. Using the Chimera's Breath to disable the Skylla will be our best chance to get everyone off the coast.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''The merchant ships\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The distraction should buy time for them to leave.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Natakas and I will make sure everyone is onboard the ships. This is our chance to leave Achaia.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Then you must go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius is right, Natakas. You should be on those ships. Both of you. They're your way out.''\n|-|I wouldn't risk it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the [[Order of the Ancients|Order]] knows both of you are on those ships, you'll be in trouble. If you're caught on the water, you'll have no way out.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Darius:''' ''What do you think, Natakas?''\nNatakas looked down pensively as he replied.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''It's our only chance.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''You have to take it.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''We will.''\nDarius took his leave.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''We'll need somewhere to stay until then... Somewhere that won't raise suspicion.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''I know just the place... A house on the hill near [[Dyme]].''\n<tabber>\n|-|We should go together.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go there now.''\nKassandra motioned to Natakas, and they left for the house together with Kleta.\n\nAfter a long journey back to Dyme, Kleta presented the house where Kassandra previously reunited with Darius.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Look at this place...''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''It belonged to a friend of mine. He tried getting out of Achaia, but... he didn't make it.''\nShe looked down in silent remembrance of her friend.\n*'''Kleta:''' ''I need to prepare the others. See you two soon.''\nKleta took her leave, giving Kassandra and Natakas the run of the place.\n|-|I'll meet you there.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go ahead. I'll meet you there.''\nNatakas and Kleta left for the house while Kassandra continued her business in Patrai.\n\nIn time, Kassandra met with them at the entrance to Dyme. Kleta simply gestured to the house where Kassandra previously met with Darius.  Kleta took her leave, and Kassandra and Natakas walked up the hill to the house together.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where's your father?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Out. He does that sometimes. He'll be back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This house...''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Kleta said it belonged to a friend of hers. He tried getting out of Achaia, but... didn't make it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n</tabber>\nNatakas commented on the atmosphere surrounding the dwelling.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''There's something about this place...''\n<tabber>\n|-|It's beautiful.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's a beautiful place. Peaceful.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I know. Too bad we won't stay...''\n|-|It's boring.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's nothing special.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I like it. It's peaceful. Too bad we won't stay...''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Natakas entering the dwelling]]\nThey walked inside.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, what's next?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''We'll probably keep running. As always.''\nNatakas' face fell, then he looked over at the table.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''At least there's wine.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''At least there's wine.''\nThey exchanged a glance and agreed to share it.\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 5.png|thumb|250px|Darius returning with the game]]\nNight fell, and Darius, with his hood down, had a slain ibex slung over his shoulder. He walked it up the hill to the house to prepare it for dinner.  Natakas roared, and he immediately dropped the deer and leapt into action.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''What have you done!''\nKassandra laughed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stop it.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''This is how I grew up.''\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 6.png|thumb|250px|Darius eavesdropping on Kassandra and Natakas]]\nDarius held position outside the door, [[Hidden Blade]] extended.  He realized that Natakas was merely reminiscing.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But seriously, your father is a very capable man.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''He is. But emotionally.... He's hard to open up.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's hard to make friends for people like us. Living on the move, as we do.''\nDarius retracted the Hidden Blade and continued eavesdropping.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Though, we've met each other.''\nKassandra held up her cup in a toast.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To our friendship.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''To our friendship.''\nDarius smiled as he heard them clink their cups together and giggle.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka. \n*'''Natakas:''' ''Mal\u00e1ka''\n\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 7.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Natakas watching the stars]]\nLater in the night, after they sobered up, Kassandra and Natakas sat on the roof and stared up at the stars, as they did on the [[More Questions than Answers|night they first met]].\n*'''Natakas:''' ''This reminds me of when we met in [[Makedonia]]\u2014we ate boar beneath the stars. It was the first time in a long time that I felt home. I haven't felt it since... Until tonight.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then let's make the most of it.''\nNatakas smiled and they continued staring up at the sky as [[Ikaros]] flew past.\n\nDawn came, and Darius and Natakas had already left. Kassandra looked out at the [[Istion Valley]] from the roof.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should find Darius and the others. The stranded people are probably at the docks already.''\nShe took another [[Leap of Faith|leap]] from the roof and traveled north, where she met Kleta overlooking the docks.\n*'''Kleta:''' ''Eagle Bearer. Over here.''\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 9.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Kleta observing the passengers as they prepared to depart]]\nNatakas stood on the beach near the dock.\n\n* '''Natakas:''' ''The boats will be ready soon. Be safe, Kassandra.''\n\nDarius stood on the dock below.\n\n* '''Darius:''' ''Eagle Bearer. Thank you. For everything.''\n\nKassandra finished talking to Natakas and Darius, then joined Kleta overlooking the passengers boarding the ship out of Achaia.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My friends.  It's probably the last I'll ever see of them.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''The last time I saw my Phila, we were arguing. We always did. I wish I had told her how much she meant to me. How proud of her I was. Now that she's back, I'm scared I won't recognize her.''\nKassandra fixated on Natakas as Kleta spoke, who appeared to be giving instructions to some of the stranded.  It looked as though he was holding back sadness. Kleta took notice of Kassandra's fixation and sensed the bond that had formed between them.\n*'''Kleta:''' ''Real connections with people are rare, Kassandra. We shouldn't be too quick to let them go.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Real connections ''are'' rare.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Real connections are hard to find. I may be letting one go right now... I don't know.''\n|-|I don't do \"connections.\"=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a ''misthios''. I can't afford connections.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Calm Before the Storm 11.png|thumb|250px|Barnabas attempting to warn the group]]\nThe first ship fully loaded and disembarked. Darius and Natakas joined the women on the cliff, when Barnabas ran up to them.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Captain! Hey, Captain!''\n*'''Darius:''' ''What's going on?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''A massive fleet has gathered nearby. They seem to be waiting for something, but we don't know what.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Tempest.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''The ship... These people...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She knows. Somehow she knows.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''They're going to kill us all in one swift blow!''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll crush the fleet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We won't be destroyed. I'll sink every last ship.''\n*'''Kleta:''' ''How?''\n|-|We're doomed.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't take on an entire fleet...''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''We have to do something, Captain!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Barnabas, ready the ship for battle. And the Chimera's Breath.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Tides of War complete=\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Aye, Captain! She's ready to go. Let's send this storm straight to [[Hades]].''\n|-|Incomplete=\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''It isn't ready yet. We haven't even finished assembling it! I'll need\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll start without it. Keep working.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Aye...''\n</tabber>\n*'''Darius:''' ''Natakas and I can handle things here. Good luck, Kassandra.''\nKassandra took her leave while Natakas looked on with worry.  The ''[[Adrestia]]'' waited in the waters below.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Barnabas should be on the Adrestia by now. I need to hurry!''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra and her entourage executed their plan to evacuate the stranded.  However, the Tempest had somehow learned of the plan and sent a fleet to dash them against the shore.  Kassandra and Barnabas took to the ''Adrestia'' to meet the fleet head on.",

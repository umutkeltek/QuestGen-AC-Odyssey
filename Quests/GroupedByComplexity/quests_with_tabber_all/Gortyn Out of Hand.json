Killing him, she recovered a [[Cult of Kosmos clues#Gods of the Aegean Sea|note]] written to him by his [[Cult of Kosmos|Cultist]] [[Melanthos|son]]. After destroying the supplies, Kassandra left the fort and returned to the politician.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's done.

    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "*Ptolemaios becomes the new Nation Leader of Messara at the conclusion of this memory, and he will immediately take up residence in [[Daidalos Fort]] with a fresh group of bodyguards affiliated with either [[Athens]] or [[Sparta]], depending on who controls the region. Should that faction later lose control of the region, he will be replaced by a randomly-generated leader for the opposing side, while he remains affiliated with the faction in control at the moment of his ascension.\n*Killing Ptolemaios after this memory will result in him eventually being replaced by another randomly-generated leader.",

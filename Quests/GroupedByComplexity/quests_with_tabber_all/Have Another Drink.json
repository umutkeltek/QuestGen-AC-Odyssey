    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra left [[Hekate]] once again and made her way west to the entrance of [[Hypnos' Path]]. Underneath the entrance, she found a note.\n*'''Memento from a Lost Soul:''' ''My dearest Anthaia, I can't bear to grieve you any longer. I leave your memory to this papyrus before I fall to [[Lethe]]'s bliss.''\nKassandra climbed to the top of the grotto and found the water deep enough to enter. She swam through the underwater caverns and found herself in Hypnos' Path, where she found a skeleton with a dagger beside it. She inspected the skeleton.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever this water does, people died trying to find it.''\nShe continued further in the cave, where some mind-controlled soldiers kept watch. She killed them and found the water in a discreet nook above the shelves. When she claimed it, she heard a voice crying out.\n*'''Beggar:''' ''Is there truly no hope? Did [[Persephone]] destroy the last of Lethe's water?''\nKassandra climbed up and found another journal.\n*'''Last Resort:''' ''If my dear doesn't love me forever, then at least I'll have this to take the pain away. Persephone won't get in the way of that. \u2013 G''\nKassandra followed the voice to a crack in the wall covered by a grain rack. She moved the rack and passed through, finding the beggar that was the voice's source.\n*'''Beggar:''' ''You entered the cave. You must have found what was left of Lethe's water.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did.''\n*'''Beggar:''' ''Oh, have mercy and let me have just a sip. I lost my wife in [[Tartaros]], and her screams still haunt me in my dreams. Please, put them to rest.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well... I guess it can't hurt. But just a sip. Someone else needs this.''\nShe uncorked the vial and fed a small amount of the water to the beggar. He began coughing, and Kassandra inspected the water quizzically, suspecting poison. Instead, the beggar's breathing settled, and he stood with no memory of her.\n*'''Beggar:''' ''Hmm? I... Who are you? Never mind. I don't think it matters.''\nThe beggar returned to his campfire, and Kassandra left the cave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got the water. Now to bring it to Hekate's [[Amaltheia|contact]].''\n\nKassandra made her way to [[Adonis' Gardens]] in [[Deukalion's Heritage]]. [[Ikaros]] spotted the villa where the contact resided.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the place.''\nKassandra infiltrated Adonis' Gardens and made her way to the villa entrance, meeting with the contact.\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''You're the contact Hekate described. Do you have Lethe's water?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do, but what's so special about it? I saw a man lose himself after just one sip.''\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''Humans here drink Lethe's water to forget their past lives and reincarnate back to the world of the living. But Persephone won't let any of us leave Elysium so long as she's trapped here, too. I lost my soulmate. I can't go back in time, but I can forget that pain. Now. Give me the water.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Here's the water.=\nKassandra handed Amaltheia the water.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, drink this.''\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''For you, my poor [[Theron]]. I'll join you in mindless bliss.''\n:(Theron liberated)\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Theron? The [[Isadore|silver tongue]]'s son? Wait\u2014''\nAmaltheia consumed the entirety of the vial and wiped away her memory.\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''I must say, I feel a touch woozy.''\nAmaltheia collapsed into unconsciousness as Kassandra shook her head.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How am I going to get you to [[Adonis]] now?''\nKassandra slung Amaltheia over her shoulder and carried her out of the gardens. She set her down at the village, and Adonis met with them as Amaltheia regained consciousness.\n*'''Adonis:''' ''What happened to her?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She took a sip of Lethe's water. I gave her the last vial.''\n*'''Adonis:''' ''What? Why would you do that?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe woman was suffering.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She didn't want to be sentenced to eternal heartbreak after losing her love in Elysium.''\n*'''Adonis:''' ''That I can understand, at least.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nShe promised to join the rebellion.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hekate told me the woman promised to join the rebellion in exchange for the water.''\n*'''Adonis:''' ''Some good she'll do the rebellion if she doesn't know who she is, let alone what she's fighting for. Sounds like one of Hekate's tricks to me.''\n}}\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She mentioned her lover's name. Theron.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nTheron liberated=\n*'''Adonis:''' ''The silver tongue's son? But you cleansed him of Persephone's possession. They could have been reunited! I should let him know.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nTheron killed=\n*'''Adonis:''' ''The silver tongue's son? I suppose since he couldn't be saved... Still. Watch your back with Hekate, Kassandra. She can't be trusted.''\n}}\nAmaltheia stood up clutching her stomach, and Adonis helped her away.\n|-|I'm destroying the water.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No. After what I've seen, no one should drink this.''\nKassandra shattered the vial on the ground, rendering the water useless.\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''You fool! Now I'm doomed to live without my poor Theron for eternity. That was my last hope.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nTheron liberated=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Theron? The silver tongue's son? I cleansed him of Persephone's possession. He's in [[Iapetos' Ruins]].''\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''What? How? I\u2014If what you're saying is true, I must see him right away. Oh, my sweet Theron.''\nAmaltheia left to reunite with Theron immediately. Kassandra left the gardens on her own.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nTheron killed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Honor your lost love. Mourn him and let him go.''\n*'''Amaltheia:''' ''Grief in the underworld follows you for eternity, always aching in your chest. You robbed me of my last hope. Adonis can forget about my help.''\nAmaltheia shoved Kassandra away. Kassandra left the villa.\n}}\n</tabber>\n\nWith the matter of Lethe's water resolved, Kassandra returned to Hekate.\n<tabber>\n|-|Gave water to Amaltheia= \n*'''Hekate:''' ''I've already received word that you accomplished just what I asked. Good.''\nPersephone stepped out from behind the column to confront Hekate.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''And what ''did'' you ask Kassandra to do for you?''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Persephone.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Rumor has it that Lethe's water has once again entered circulation in Elysium.''\nHekate tried to speak, but Persephone anticipated her words and cut her off.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Don't you dare try to talk your way out of this. You are the ''only'' person who knows what Lethe's water means to me.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''I'm sorry.''\nPersephone turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''You would never understand the intricacies of a divine creation like Lethe's water. But I won't forget what part you played here.''\n|-|Destroyed water=\n*'''Hekate:''' ''You did nothing close to what I asked you.''\nPersephone stepped out from behind the column to confront Hekate.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''And what ''did'' you ask Kassandra to do for you?''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Persephone.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Rumor has it that Lethe's water has once again entered circulation in Elysium.''\nHekate tried to speak, but Persephone anticipated her words and cut her off.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Don't you dare try to talk your way out of this. You are the ''only'' person who knows what Lethe's water means to me.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''I'm sorry.''\nPersephone turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''It's hard for a human to understand the consequences of drinking from Lethe's River. You succeeded where I failed.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Persephone, I was only trying to...''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I'll be watching you more closely from now on, friend.''\nPersephone left.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This wasn't about helping Adonis at all. You knew that woman would be no use to the rebellion after drinking the water.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''The woman did promise her help\u2014that wasn't a lie. As for my motives, I've told you from the start they are mine alone to know. But if humans so desperately desire to move on from their pasts, Persephone shouldn't make that choice for them.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Persephone's right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From what I've seen, nothing good comes from drinking that water.''\n|-|You were right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If humans want to drink from Lethe's River, it's a choice they can make for themselves. With or without Persephone's permission.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hekate:''' ''I wasn't asking for your opinion on the matter. I need some time alone. Away from your mindless chatter.''\nHekate left.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra recovered the last of Lethe's water and either gave it to Amaltheia or destroyed it.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "If Theron was saved during \"[[Good News]]\" and the water is destroyed, Amaltheia will reunite with him no worse for wear, though this has no long-term impact on the ending of the episode.\n\nIf players destroy the water Hekate will be angry with them, but doing so will help in convincing Persephone that Hekate cannot be trusted.\n\nThis quest is a pre-requisite for [[The Beacons Are Lit]].",

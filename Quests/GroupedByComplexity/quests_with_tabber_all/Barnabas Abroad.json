He inhaled deeply while talking to her.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Welcome to the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]! Breathe in. Can you not taste the excitement in the air?''\nThey began to walk through the city.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you going to be like this the whole time we're here?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''By the [[Twelve Gods|gods]], yes!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll try and win quickly then.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Come now. You must be feeling something.''\nKassandra laughed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm just having fun with you. Who wouldn't be impressed?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''It is a place of immortal glory\u2014you can be sure [[Hera]] and [[Zeus]] will be watching your performance closely.''\nShe replied sarcastically.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh, no pressure, then.''\nBarnabas chuckled.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Forget that for the moment, and let's enjoy the sights and see what Olympia has to offer.''\nThey walked for a bit, then turned back to look at the grand entrance with the banners of [[Elis]].\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Isn't this magnificent?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's certainly impressive. Though I'm sad we'll be missing the [[chariot]] races.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Oh, what I would have given to see that!''\nHe turned towards her.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''We should take in the sights and praise the gods to be here at such a time.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Which sights should we see?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''There're so many! Let me think... The [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], the [[Altar of Zeus]], and of course, the [[Olympic Tree]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Maybe later.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have fun Barnabas\u2014I'll catch up with you later.''\nKassandra returned.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enjoying the Olympics so far?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Even more than I imagined. There's so much to see and do!''\n(If players chose \"I'll meet you at the altar.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should make an offering to Zeus for good luck in the Games.''\n[[File:ACOD Altar of Zeus - Kassandra and Barnabas.png|thumb|250px|Barnabas and Kassandra at the Altar of Zeus]]\nThey met at the entryway to the Altar of Zeus, flanked by two bull statues.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''To think I would see such an offering to the gods in Olympia itself...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've never seen anything like this.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''And this is nothing! On the final day the ''mageiros'' will slaughter a hundred [[Cattle|bulls]] for the hecatomb to honor Zeus.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Disgusting!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ugh, I think I've had enough of the stench of offal and burned meat.''\n|-|Delicious!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could eat.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''But that's not for people like us!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's wrong with people like us?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nGive me some meat.=\nKassandra turned to a butcher nearby.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hey, give me some of that meat. The gods won't miss it.''\n*'''Butcher:''' ''I won't anger the gods for your belly. Get lost.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI'll pay for some meat. [200]=\nKassandra turned to a butcher nearby and handed him some [[drachma]]e.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My friend here would like to savor your offering. I have the drachmae.''\n*'''Butcher:''' ''Won't say no to some extra drachmae.''\nBarnabas had a taste.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Mmm, delicious. Thank you, my friend.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gladly. I know how much this all means to you.''\n}}\n</tabber>\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Well then, I think we've spent enough time here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Agreed. Let's go.''\n(If players chose \"I'll meet you at the altar.\" after having visited the Altar of Zeus.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What about the Altar of Zeus?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''We've already been.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All these things with Zeus in the name\u2014I get confused!''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''It's Olympia. What do you expect?''\n(If players chose \"I'll meet you at the temple.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We're in Olympia. It's only fitting we visit the Temple of Zeus.''\n[[File:ACOD Statue of Zeus - Kassandra and Barnabas.png|thumb|250px|Barnabas and Kassandra inside the Temple of Zeus]]\nKassandra entered the huge temple in the middle of Olympia and approached Barnabas at the feet of the massive [[Statue of Zeus, Olympia|Statue of Zeus]]. They both gazed up at it.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I heard it's one of the [[Wonders of the World|wonders of the world]]\u2014and sculpted by your friend, [[Phidias]]!''\nThey turned their gazes to one another.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd hardly say friend. Even acquaintance might be pushing it.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Can't you just feel the presence of Zeus and Hera when you stand here?''\nKassandra replied sarcastically.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought it was the wind.''\nBarnabas barked back with godly fear:\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Don't mock the gods.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I don't owe the gods anything.=\nKassandra responded sharply.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My life's been tainted by prophecy and the word of the gods. I've yet to see their hand in anything in this life.''\nBarnabas nodded slightly, sympathetic to her point.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You may not see it, but they have steered you to greatness. You will be a hero for the ages!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''At what cost?''\n|-|Forgive me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry. I don't want my feelings to cast a shadow on your day.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Don't think of yourself as tortured by the gods, but as molded for greatness by their hands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am ''molded'' by no one's hands. If the gods know me, they watch in silence.''\nBarnabas sighed as they turned away from the statue.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Come. Let's leave this place. Fortunately for you, I have enough faith for the both of us!''\n(If players chose \"I'll meet you at the temple.\" after having visited the Temple of Zeus.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have I seen the temple?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Yes. Are you paying attention?''\n(If players chose \"I'll meet you at the tree.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like to see the Olympic Tree.''\nThey met at the foot of the Olympic Tree, where there was a cheering crowd.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You brought me to see a tree?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Not just any tree. This is the sacred tree from which the winners ''kotinos'' are made.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd rather have drachmae than a wreath.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''A kotinos is no ordinary wreath. The [[olive]] branches are harvested by children and taken to the [[Temple of Hera, Olympia|temple of Hera]]. There, the ''{{Wiki|Hellanodikai}}'', or judges, make the wreaths.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I guess they'll be lighter to carry back to [[Sparta]] than gold.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''At least you see the practicality, if not the wonder, of the Olympic wreaths.''\n(If players chose \"I'll meet you at the tree.\" after having visited the Olympic Tree.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Should we see the Olympic Tree?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Were you sleeping? We've been there.''\nAfter their tour was over, they convened in the walkway between the Olympic Tree and the [[Olympic Gymnasium]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Barnabas?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Yes?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you for this. I hope I wasn't too much of a distraction.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''No, it was made better by your company.''\n[[File:ACOD_Barnabas_Abroad_-_Barnabas_and_Kassandra_hug.png|thumb|250px|Barnabas and Kassandra hugging]]\nThe two embraced.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''A flock of [[Harpy|harpies]] couldn't dampen my spirits\u2014we're at the Olympics! You're competing, and I believe you'll win.''\nKassandra laughed heartily as they returned to the task at hand.",

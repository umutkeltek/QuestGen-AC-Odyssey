You'll never be able to take him down, anyway.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Exceptional. I've been tracking the Monger from the moment the rifts appeared. There's just one problem. The Lost Temple of Nyx is behind the [[Tartaros Veil|Veil]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Veil?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Since Cerberos was killed, it's spilled out into the underworld. The Veil of Tartaros was created to keep out living mortals so that only those beyond redemption could enter the prison for the wicked.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Which means you'll make it through just fine. But Charon said I would need [[armor]].''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Yes, the [[Armor of the Fallen]]. Lucky for you, I may be able to help so we can both infiltrate the Monger's hideout.''\n(Asked \"Why would you come?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want to storm the Monger's hideout together?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Of course. A chance to fight alongside the mighty Eagle Bearer? No one would turn that down. Besides, this is my opportunity to prove that I've changed.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Let's find the armor.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Charon already told me that four of the armor pieces are guarded by [[the Fallen]], but that the [[Gauntlets of the Fallen|gauntlets]] were lost long ago.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Charon tends to confuse lost with misplaced. Rest assured, I will help you find the gauntlets. Meet me at [[Kronos' Treasury]].''",

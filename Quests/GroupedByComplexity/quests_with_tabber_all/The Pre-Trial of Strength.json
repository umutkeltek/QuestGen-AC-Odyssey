Your only logical choice is to purchase the Trial Token from him. Be wise, friend.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''By [[Zeus]], my legs! If only I hadn't tried to fight the Trial Master. I should have paid him. I SHOULD HAVE PAID HIM!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Put down your [[spear]] and grab your [[drachma]]e, challenger - for only honorable bribery can save you from sharing my astoundingly painful fate!''\n*'''Civilian:''' Oh my bones!

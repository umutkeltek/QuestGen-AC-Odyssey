    "Section_Dialogue": "As they neared Paros, Barnabas grew excited.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Approaching Paros! This is where I saw [[Leda (Barnabas' wife)|my wife]] drinking wine with a beautiful [[Circe|witch]].''\nKassandra left the ship, and went to explore [[Atoll Point]]. On a hill, she saw [[Atoll Point ruins|ruins]] fitting Barnabas' description, and headed towards them. Within she saw a number of apparently tame [[pig]]s, [[wild boar]]s, and [[lion]]s, as well as a woman drinking the blood of a slain pig.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These pigs... look hungry.''\nShe approached the woman. Noticing her, the woman rose and turned to greet her.\n*'''Circe:''' ''Welcome to my empire, traveler. I am its empress, [[Circe (mythology)|Circe]] of the [[Oceanid]]s.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You live here?''\n*'''Circe:''' ''Where are my manners? You must be weary after your long journey. There's some wine in my hold, if you'd fetch it for us. I'm a bit indisposed at the moment.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I could use some wine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could use a drink. I'll fetch the wine.''\nKassandra left Circe. Near the pillars, a flower drew her attention.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is [[moly]], a natural antidote for [[poison]]. I should take some just in case.''\nShe continued to the ruins down the hill, studying them. On a broken pillar, she saw a toy doll, and inspected it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This toy has teeth marks.''\nOn the ground near the toy and the wine was a clay tablet.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This says her subjects are hungry. What subjects?''\nNearby, the stones were stained with blood.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Could this blood be [[human]]?''\nShe found the wine, and grabbed it before heading back to Circe. She gave the wine to Circe, who smiled.\n*'''Circe:''' ''You look deliciously thirsty.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll drink the wine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, \"empress.\" Let's drink.''\nThey toasted, and Kassandra drained her cup while Circe smiled, not drinking a drop. When Kassandra remained unaffected, Circe was dumbstruck.\n*'''Circe:''' ''You didn't succumb.''\n(If \"What are you doing here?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why do you live out here on your own?''\n*'''Circe:''' ''A woman like me has no place in this world. Out there, they call me witch. Here, I am my own empress, with my subjects to protect me.''\n(If \"Why is your wine poisoned?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why try to poison me?''\n*'''Circe:''' ''My subjects need to be fed. You drink the cursed wine. They feed on your flesh. The curse passes on to them, and they remain in my control.''\n(If \"Enough games.\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough. I'm looking for a woman named Leda. My friend believes she visited here.''\n*'''Circe:''' ''My boars devour all. But if she had, I would have kept a trophy. This bracelet is from the last woman who came to my empire.''\nCirce showed off the bracelet around her wrist.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give it to me.''\nKassandra took the bracelet from the unresisting Circe.\n*'''Circe:''' ''And what will you do to me and my subjects? Kill us?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nJoin my crew.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're resourceful... I could use someone like you on my ship. Leave this solitude and join us.''\n*'''Circe:''' ''My ''pater'' had my ''mater'' flayed for being a witch. He'd have killed me, too, until I... Well. He won't be hurting anyone now. Tell me, would you set a tigress loose on your deck?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think you'll fit in just fine.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThreaten \u2013 Stay out of my way.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll spare you. But if you get in my way, I will gut you and every animal here.''\nCirce turned away from her without a word, but the animals attacked Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Circe! I will rip you apart and feed you to your animals?''\n*'''Circe:''' ''How dare you challenge an empress?''\nKassandra slew Circe. On her corpse, she found a particular bracelet, as well as a list of Circe's victims and trophies.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The witch kept a list of names... and trophies. This bracelet was worn by a \"Leda.\"''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nFight \u2013 Prepare to die.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't know what evil ritual you performed on Leda, but I'll kill you for it, witch!''\n*'''Circe:''' ''My subjects will protect me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Circe!

Drink your last drink. Breathe your last breath. My subjects grow hungry.''\nKassandra reeled as she spoke, feeling the effects of whatever was in the cup. Kassandra lost consciousness, only to wake up on cold stone floor in darkness.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka'', my head. Where am I?''\nShe stood up, holding her head. A wild boar approached her from the darkness. Kassandra slew it and made her way out of the [[Alkaios Tomb|tomb]] and back to Circe's ruins.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Circe! I will rip you apart and feed you to your animals?''\n*'''Circe:''' ''How dare you challenge an empress?''\nKassandra slew Circe.

From L, a commoner's bracelet. From M, a clay pot. P surrendered his [[sword]]. From X, nothing. A total waste. From K...''\nWith the note and bracelet in hand, she returned to the ''Adrestia'' to inform Barnabas of what she had discovered.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''About my Leda, do you have any news?''\n(Chose \"I got this bracelet from Circe.\")<br />\nKassandra dug out the bracelet, and showed it to Barnabas.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found this bracelet... and a lot of pigs.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I can explain. Leda had it and was transformed into a pig by Circe.

But never mind them.''\n</tabber>\nBarnabas took the bracelet.",

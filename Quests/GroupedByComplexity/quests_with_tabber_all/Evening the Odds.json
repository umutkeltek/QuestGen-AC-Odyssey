I'm really going to need a [[Leonidas I of Sparta|Leonidas]] to get out of this mess.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you playing [[Dienekes]] for Thespis?''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''I was, but now I can't. I lost all I had gambling with a [[Taureas|commander]]. Now he says I'm his [[Slavery|slave]] until I pay off the debt. I'll be working for him for years!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's settle this debt.''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''Oh, thank you! The commander is right over there.''\nThe actor directed Kassandra towards a building on the left. She went over with him and found the commander with two women. The commander signalled the women to leave.\n*'''Taureas:''' ''You want to play another game? So glad you brought company.''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''No, I, well...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need my friend back. He's due to act in a play. I think it's time you let him leave.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''What's the play?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Leonidas and His 300 Spartans.\" This man plays Dienekes, Leonidas' lieutenant.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''A good military play. We need more of those on the stage. Of course, it would be best if they cast real soldiers instead of namby-pamby actors.''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''I'm not\u2014oh, never mind.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''So here's how it is, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. This ''mal\u00e1kas'' owes me a debt that he is paying off with service. Do you intend to take his place?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll work off his debt to free him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's make a deal. My services as a ''misthios'' against his debt.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''Works for me. My [[soldier]]s used to be stationed at the [[Stable of Augeias]]. We've relocated since then, but left behind a good luck charm by mistake. Bring it back, and we'll call this even.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is that all? I'll be back before you know it.''\nKassandra travelled to the Stable of Augeias which had been now inhabited by [[Wolf|wolves]]. After eliminating the wolves, she recovered the charm on the second floor.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. I should return this to the commander.''\nKassandra returned to the actor and Taureas at the square.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found that good luck charm you mentioned. And the wolves you didn't.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''Which I'm sure were no problem for a ''misthios'' like you. Now, give me back my [[sword]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You never said this was a sword.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''The best kind of luck is a fine blade. Hand it over.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nHere's your weapon.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here you go. I take it we're even?''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''Yes, this will cover his debt. Now, both of you, get out of my sight.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should leave. Follow me.''\nKassandra left with the actor back to the working area.\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''Do you think that commander will really leave me alone?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe he won't. But if you're playing Dienekes, you must be ready to defend yourself. A Spartan doesn't cower at home just because he has enemies!''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''But I'm only a Spartan in a play.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you want to convince your audience or not? Dienekes had to live with the fear of being killed every day. Why should it be different for you?''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''I see. Knowing that commander could show up at my home any day with a dozen men and set [[spear]]s at my throat... That fear will inform my character. Thank you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're welcome. Now get back to Thespis for rehearsals.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nAttack \u2013 I'm not handing this over.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Actually, I like it. I think I'll keep it.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''Filthy ''misthios''! You dare disobey someone of my rank? I'll make you regret this.''\nKassandra and Taureas drew their swords, attacking each other. Kassandra eventually bested Taureas and killed him.\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''You\u2014you killed him!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're playing Dienekes, you should be used to bloodshed. You're [[Sparta]]n and the right-hand man of a king!''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''But that's a play, and this is\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Reality? Dienekes didn't have that luxury. If you want to play a soldier, learn to be one.''\nThe actor nodded and stood up.\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''You're right. I can't be intimidated by a little bloodshed. I'll do the story of Leonidas proud.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good.

After all, you're a \"real soldier,\" right?\n*'''Taureas:''' ''By Ares's ass of course I am! Sure, I'll be Dienekes in your little play.''\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''But what about me?''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''My soldiers have plenty of sandals that need repairing and blades that need sharpening. I'm sure you'll keep busy while I'm showing these civilians how to act.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou'll be great.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll be great in the role. Just let your natural commanding spirit come through.''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''I can do that. Compared to marching into battle, this will be like eating grapes off a vine.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Report to Thespis at Pelops Market in Elis. He'll get a Dienekes, just maybe not the one he's expecting.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou'll have to work for it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You think acting is easy? Were any of your soldiers good when they first signed up? You'll need to listen to your director and drill your lines until you can recite them without hesitation.''\n* '''Taureas:''' ''Oh I hear you. I'll rehearse twice as hard as any of the other so-called actors.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Report to Thespis at Pelops Market in Elis. He'll get a Dienekes, just maybe not the one he's expecting.''\n}}\n|-|Attack \u2013 I'm not paying you anything.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How about you apologize for taking advantage of this man and wasting my time?''\n*'''Taureas:''' ''You dare speak to your better like this? No one will miss such an impudent tongue.''\nKassandra and Taureas drew their swords, attacking each other. Kassandra eventually bested Taureas and killed him.\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''You\u2014you killed him!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're playing Dienekes, you should be used to bloodshed.

You'll see!''\nKassandra made her way to the warehouse, with traces of the murder left behind. She investigated a bracelet left on the ground in a corner.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This bracelet looks expensive.

There, she found a blooded tablet, likely the murder weapon.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the murder weapon. It's caked in dry blood\u2014heavy too.

And make it a slow, painful execution.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will be done.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Thank you, misthios, for clearing my name.''\nKassandra tracked down the leader of Kythera, killing him and his [[guards]].\n\n|-|It was the man beside you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was him.

Regardless, Kassandra will be asked to hunt down either of them. If Kassandra identified the leader as the one responsible, he can be found at either the [[Shrine of Aphrodite, Kythera|Shrine of Aphrodite]] or the [[Leader House, Kythera|Leader House]].",

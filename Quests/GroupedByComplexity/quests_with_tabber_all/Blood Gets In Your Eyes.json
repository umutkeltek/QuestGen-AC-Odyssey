You distract [[Atlas]] while I sneak into his private chambers.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''More sneaking.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''After [[Poseidon]] outlawed [[human]] experiments, Atlas confiscated a device and kept it. That device theoretically could add a third helix to my DNA.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've seen what these Isu devices can do. It's not pretty.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''The science is sound, and I've even found evidence of tests being done on humans that looked promising. In previous cycles, of course, before Poseidon outlawed experimentation.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell Atlas the truth.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just tell Atlas the truth. You have good intentions''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''If he's afraid of his enemies hurting me now, what will he think of me undergoing this procedure? Besides, he can't break Poseidon's law.''\n|-|Atlas won't like this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Last I checked, he seemed pretty power hungry. I don't think he wants to share his throne.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Behind every great man is a great woman. I ''can'' make Atlas see that,'' Dikastes.\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not sure a good ''Dikastes'' goes behind the back of an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] Archon.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I've been preparing for this my entire life. Don't worry. Just keep Atlas talking while I'm in his chambers.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't think we have anything in common. What are we supposed to talk about? The weather?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Atlas is a jealous lover, ''and'' he's already threatened by your role as ''Dikastes''. Why not play to that advantage? Whatever you do, don't mention my plans.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Great. This will do wonders for our relationship.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Everyone knows it's lonely at the top, ''Dikastes''. Let's go.''\nKassandra and Elpis headed to Atlas' throne room.\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I've studied this science extensively. Once I impart Isu DNA into my body. I ''should'' be able to use the device without side effects.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's the \"should\" that worries me.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Remember, whatever you do, don't reveal my political plans to Atlas.''\nBefore they entered the throne room Kassandra turned to Elpis.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I ''could'' trick Atlas into thinking you and I are closer than we are.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Are we not close? What's there to trick.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know what I mean.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Yes, making Atlas envious would certainly be a good distraction.''\nKassandra and Elpis entered the throne room where they found Atlas posing for his servant who painted him. Atlas was surprised to see Elpis in his Doma.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Elpis? What are you doing here? With her no less?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''The ''Dikastes'' and I were just taking a stroll and I remembered I left a book on Atlantean cyclical history here. She'd like to borrow it Do you mind if I fetch it?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I - No. Do you need me to help you look for it?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''No, no. You two stay here. I'm sure you have much to discuss.''\nElpis headed to Atlas' private chambers.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|(Undetected at the Adamant Metallon)=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''What game are you playing at, ''Dikastes''?''\n|-|(Detected)=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Elpis wouldn't have anything to do with why you were sneaking around the [[Adamant Metallon]], would she?''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't know what you're talking about.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I'm sure by now Elpis has told you about the nature of our relationship. She's hardly as discreet as I'd like her to be. What business do you have with her?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|We're getting to know each other.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What? Is Elpis not allowed to have friends?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Of course she can have friends. But I suspect there's more going on here.''\n|-|I'm helping her become Isu.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've had enough of these secrets! Elpis wants to become Isu like you. She's using a device in your palace to do it.''\n(Proceed to \"Elpis is foiled\" ending)\n|-|We're discussing politics.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpis was just sharing her thoughts on ways we can improve relations between Isu and humans.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''That woman is always angling to stick her nose where it doesn't belong.''\n|-|(time expired)=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Really? You have nothing to say for yourself?''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have nothing to worry about, Atlas. I have no schemes against you.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Maybe you don't play games, but Elpis lives for them. I can tell when she's up to something.''\nAtlas turned and marched towards the study.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Don't talk about her like that.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't talk about Elpis that way. She's not manipulative. She's passionate.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''So you ''do'' care for her, then.''\n|-|I'm helping her become Isu.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've had enough of these secrets! Elpis wants to become Isu like you. She's using a device in your palace to do it.''\n(Proceed to \"Elpis is foiled\" ending)\n|-|Involve her more in politics.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpis cares about policy in Atlantis. Involve her, and hear what she has to say.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''It's not her place! It's mine.''\n|-|(time expired)=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''This is the price I pay for involving myself with someone so ambitious.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't talk about Elpis like you ''love'' her.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''And you're not speaking of her as if you're merely her casual acquaintance.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I believe in her cause.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpis makes great points about improving the lives of humans in Atlantis. I support her cause. Why don't you?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''She should support'' me.\n|-|I'm helping her become Isu.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've had enough of these secrets! Elpis wants to become Isu like you. She's using a device in your palace to do it.''\n(Proceed to \"Elpis is foiled\" ending)\n|-|Lie \u2013 We're in love.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The truth is Elpis and I are in love!''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''What?''\n|-|(time expired)=\nKassandra shrugged.\n</tabber>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Elpis succeeds=\nA flash of light emanated from the side chamber. Elpis emerged as a hybrid, her transformation completed successfully.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''What... What have you done?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I'm not weak anymore, Atlas. I can rule Atlantis at your side!''\nAtlas considered the developments in front of him, then turned to accuse Kassandra.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''This is your doing. You're trying to revolt against the Isu with hybrids.''\nHe grabbed Kassandra by the throat.\n*'''Elpis:''' ''No!''\nElpis held out her hand begging him to stop, only to accidentally fire a beam of light from her palm and strike Atlas in the chest, killing him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did you do?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I didn't mean to. He was going to kill you!''\nThe two looked up and saw the human messenger sitting at his easel, staring at them. He looked away sheepishly with a slight smile.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nAtlas' brothers were saved=\n[[Azaes]] entered the throne room.\n*'''Azaes:''' ''Ah. It seems my brother finally got his due. Was this your judgment, ''Dikastes''?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I killed Atlas. It wasn't my intention. I...''\n*'''Azaes:''' ''You hoped to rule by his side to ease the conflict between humans and Isu.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''He wasn't as supportive of my dreams as I would have hoped.''\n*'''Azaes:''' ''I support you. You can assume his role as you see fit. I will handle Poseidon and my brothers.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Thank you, Azaes.''\n*'''Azaes:''' ''You can't be more corrupt than Atlas. And Atlantis can't fear progress if it hopes to pass this cycle.''\nAzaes took his leave.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nAtlas' brothers were executed=\nPoseidon entered the throne room.\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''So this is your judgment, ''Dikastes''? That all my sons are to die?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't kill\u2014''\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''But your actions allowed this to happen. Did you not help this human? And are all my sons not dead?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''This was my fault. I take full responsibility for my actions.''\nPoseidon shook his head.\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''This could not have happened without the ''Dikastes''. The very one I appointed. I will need to ponder what this means for our cycle.<br> Still, you bested Atlantis's highest Archon. By our laws, that means you may rule. But beware the ramifications this will have on our society.''\nPoseidon took his leave.\n}}\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Atlantean politics are even more dramatic than in the Greek world. What will you do now?''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I'm not the first Atlantean ruler to take power by force. If the Isu can do it, why not me? Still, I didn't want my reign to start this way.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nRule with compassion.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bring the good you've always dreamed of to your reign.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I will, ''Dikastes''. thank you for your help.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nFlirt \u2013 You saved me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You started your reign by saving my life. Normally, I do the saving.''\n(If flirted at least once before)<br>\nElpis kissed Kassandra on the cheek.\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you, ''Dikastes.\n(If never flirted)\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Hopefully this is the start of me saving many lives here in Atlantis. Thank you, ''Dikastes.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nRule with strength.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said it yourself. The Isu are cold and calculating. You need to rule with strength if you hope to survive.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''I will, ''Dikastes''. thank you for your help.''\n}}\nElpis walked to her throne as the messenger bowed. She sat upon it and began her reign as Archon.\n:(If talked to her again)\n:*'''Elpis:''' ''I'll make progress for humans in Atlantis, slowly but surely. thank you again.''\nKassandra left and pondered about Elpis' rule.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpis will make a better ruler than Atlas. Sher certainly can't do any worse.''\n|-|Elpis is foiled=\nAtlas marched into the side chamber and grabbed Elpis, throwing her out before she could complete her transformation.\n*'''Elpis:''' ''Atlas, stop!''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''You betrayed me. You used knowledge I told you in confidence for your own political gain.''\n*'''Elpis:''' ''It was for Atlantis! I don't want to be your weakness anymore. I can help you, Atlas!''\nAtlas for a moment seemed confused and not sure what to do.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Lies! You used me!''\nWhen Atlas raised his hand, Kassandra tried to step in.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait, don't!''\nKassandra wasn't able to prevent Atlas from firing a beam of light at Elpis, who fell to the ground. Kassandra kneeled next to Elpis only to watch her die.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''This is your fault! Dikastes wasn't enough? You had to steal away my father's love. Turn Elpis against me. You want to rule my Doma, too?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, it had nothing to do with that!''\nAtlas went after Kassandra and grabbed her by the neck and pushed her away.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Traitor! You're no longer welcome here. Guards!''\nAtlas turned araound and left Kassandra to be handled by his guards.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''! I need to get out of here.''\nThe guards tried to stop Kassandra but she was able to escape.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was a lot to take in. I need a moment to clear my head.''\n</tabber>",

A tired competitor is an easy target for someone with stamina. I make regular offerings to [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]] to stay fast.''\n(If players choose \"What do I win?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And if I win this race, what will I get?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Bragging rights alone.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Great.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''It's not the result you should be after, it's the training.

You said race to the high point-''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Yes! The plateau on the other side of [[Small settlement|town]]. When I say go, the race is on. Three... Two... One...<br>Go!''\nThe two women began running towards Lover's Leap.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Come on, champion!

I can be so focused on [[drachma]]e that I lose sight of what's in front of me.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''And what's that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The ocean breeze on my face. The [[sun]] on my skin. A sturdy [[horse]] to ride.''\n(If players choose \"Yes, it's the training.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All this training leaves no time for fun.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I can tell you're holding something back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''...Maybe.''\nThey were silent for a moment, and Roxana turned to face the view as well, stepping closer to the cliff.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I come up here to remind myself to live in the moment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can see how that might work.''\nThe two women continued to chat long past sundown, laughing and relaxed.\n<tabber>\n|-|If nothing particular done?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you told [[Barnabas]] there was a sea monster living in your ear, he'd believe you.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''He sounds like a real dimwit.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Actually, he's one of the most genuine people I've ever met.''\n|-|If Empedokles-questchain completed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm telling you, [[Empedokles|he]] was never fully dressed.

I can't give up any edge.''\nKassandra got up and prepared to depart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was good to meet you, Roxana, but it's time to get back to the real world.

You don't know how different it will be from my average day.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know one way it'll differ.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''How's that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will be shorter.''\nKassandra got up and prepared to depart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was good to meet you, Roxana, but it's time to get back to the real world.

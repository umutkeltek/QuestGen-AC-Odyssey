    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra recovered the reward near the [[Sunken Temple of Demeter]], getting the chance to meet Aiantides himself.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "This quest will be available if players have finished the previous quests that involve the character Aiantides, \"[[Thank You, Mal\u00e1ka!|Thank You, ''Mal\u00e1ka''!]]\" and \"[[Again, Mal\u00e1ka?!|Again, ''Mal\u00e1ka''?!]]\". The number of favors players can ask of Aiantides depends on which quests have been completed. If, for example, they have already found the mercenaries who hunted them in \"[[Knives in the Dark]]\", found the code books in \"[[Tides of War]]\", and killed The Tempest in \"[[Leviathan's Maw]]\", the only dialogue options available are to recruit Aiantides or tell him to leave. If these quests have instead not been done and the player runs through all three payback options which Aiantides rejects, the protagonist will automatically state the \"Just leave me alone\" option and dismiss him.",

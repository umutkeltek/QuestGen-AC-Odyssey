I cannot help you.''\nAn individual watched from afar, which the harbormaster spotted.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Her son is very worried.''\nThe Isu glanced at the watcher before kneeling down.\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:''' ''Please do not asphyxiate me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you doing?''\nThe harbormaster whispered.\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:''' ''I like [[human]]s. And I liked Rhene! Poor Alkon! But if they hear me talking to you they'll kill me.''\nThe harbormaster stood up.\n<tabber>\n|-|Fine, I'll play along.=\nKassandra winked, agreeing to go with the harbormaster's plan. She drew out her [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where she is or I'll cut you.''\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:''' ''I told you I don't know anything!''\nThe harbormaster leaned closer to Kassandra.\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:'''  ''You'll find my contact not far from here. But be careful, a traps has been set for you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've made the ''Dikastes'' very angry!''\nKassandra then whispered to the harbormaster.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you!''\nShe sheathed her spear and the harbor master finished their performance aloud.\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:''' ''Please don't tell [[Poseidon]].''\nThe individual watching them left.\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:''' ''You have compassion, ''Dikastes''. You may be the only one who can calm the brewing storm between humans and Isu.''\nKassandra departed the harbor and headed inwards towards the city.

But one of my contacts is nearby. Get your answers there.''\nThe individual cracked their knuckles.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now, was that so hard?''\n*'''Isu Harbormaster:''' ''Poseidon was wrong. A storm is brewing between humans and Isu, ''Dikastes''. And I fear you will only serve to hasten its imminent arrival.''\nKassandra departed the harbor and headed inwards towards the city.

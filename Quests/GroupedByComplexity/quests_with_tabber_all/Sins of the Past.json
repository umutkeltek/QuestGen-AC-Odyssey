Would you say you've killed many people?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why do you ask me that?''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''If someone is impious to the point of doing grave injustice to people as well as the gods, do they not deserve punishment?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did Praxithea do?''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''She spoke false prophecies for years. Those who came to her for advice received only lies.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your grandmother... was an [[Pythia|oracle]]?''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''Yes, up on the hill in [[Sanctuary of Delphi|Delphi]]! She confessed to me recently that she never heard the gods, and only repeated the words she was told.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Told by [[Cult of Kosmos|vile people]] with evil intentions.''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''Exactly. Wars have been fought over those words. She can't be left unpunished, I...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My family was torn apart by a false prophecy. If it was one of hers, I may take matters into my own hands.''\nThey reached a small residence, where a [[Agave|woman]] was at.\n*'''Agave:''' ''Get out of here, Lykaon. I know what you want to do. You'll just bring more shame on our family.''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''I don't want to do this, Agave. But for the sake of justice, we can't let Praxithea live.''\n*'''Agave:''' ''It's out of your hands anyway. Some strange men were searching the village today, looking for her. I brought them there, and they dragged her away.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What kind of justice is that?''\n*'''Agave:''' ''You wouldn't understand, she was an impious old fool. Now we have nothing more to worry about. Who are you, anyway?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm Kassandra. I've also been wronged by a false prophecy. It might have been your grandmother's.''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''If we don't find her, we can't settle any of this. Please help me figure out where she's been taken.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll look for clues.''\nLykan continued to debate with Agave.\n*'''Agave:''' ''What did you expect me to do? All that talk about killing... A solution showed up, so I took it.''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''That wasn't the way it was supposed to happen. She's my responsibility, not yours.''\nKassandra went into the courtyard, finding a bracelet on the floor.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Praxithea must have lost this bracelet in the struggle. But no ordinary [[thief]] would have left something so valuable behind.''\nKassandra left the house and and headed to a small brazier left of the house. She found a burned note.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like a contract: \"Deliver the package to the drop-off, and don't damage it.\" If they mean Lykaon's grandmother, chances are she's alive.''\nShe spoke to a civilian nearby.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you seen anything strange going on around here?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Well, if bandits taking over my cousin's [[Farmhouse|farm]] is strange, yes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did they do?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Gave her a running start. She can't go back there. They've set up camp, and they're armed and dangerous!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Interesting. Where is that farm?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''It's not far west of here. But I wouldn't mess with those bandits.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thanks for the advice.''\nKassandra returned to Lykaon.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Praxithea was kidnapped and brought to a farm west of here. The bandits were hired to deliver her alive.''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''Thank you for figuring that out, Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm no fool, Lykaon. Your sister put Praxithea in great danger, and you've been asking me about killing. Do you want me to end her life?''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''No, it has to be me. I need to kill her.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're a physician, not a killer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's your grandmother, and you're no killer. You should give this more thought.''\n|-|If you want me to kill her, say it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're no killer. I am. If she's done the harm you've said she has, then it seems like you need my services.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''She's my responsibility. I don't want her to suffer. That's why I asked you for mandrake. It's a painkiller. But for now, will you go to the farm to stop those bandits? I don't think I can take them all on myself.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go find Praxithea.''\n*'''Lykaon:''' ''Thanks Kassandra. You said the farm was to the west. I'll meet you there.''",

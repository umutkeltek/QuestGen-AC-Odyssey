I will cut your throat.''\nShe released the Pythia.\n*'''Pythia:''' ''I'm dead already. They'll find out you were here. And they'll kill me for it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who? This [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]] of [[Kosmos]]?''\nThe Pythia struggled to speak. Kassandra raised the back of her hand.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Speak!''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Yes, the Cult wants you dead. They know you're here.''\n|-|Please, I need to know.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for my family, and everywhere I go people are either lying or trying to kill me. You're the first person who might have some answers.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''But they'll kill me if I tell you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not if I get to them first. Help me and no harm will come to you, I promise.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''All right, but ask your questions quickly. The longer you're here, the more at risk we both are.''\n</tabber>\n(If \"What is the Cult of Kosmos?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is this Cult of Kosmos?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''They are the eyes that see, but go unseen.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough with the riddles. I want names!''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''I don't know! I swear. They hide behind masks and shrouds.''\n(If \"Why do you work for them?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would you work for the Cult?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''I have no choice.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So all those prophecies from the gods, all those people, you're paid to deceive them all?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Most want to know about love or death. I tell them what they want to hear. But when people want to know about war or politics, I'm paid very well to tell them what the ''Cult'' wants them to hear.''\n(If \"Where did the visions come from?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said you saw me in your visions, what did you see?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''There is an [[Pyramid (Isu)|artifact]] under the temple of Apollo. It reveals what only the gods should know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You called me the child on the mountain.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''The Cult hunts a [[Sparta]]n child who survived a terrible fall from [[Mount Taygetos]]. The artifact revealed that child to be you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have an opportunity to do the right thing. Tell me where to find the Cult. Tell me where they are, or we'll go find them together.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Beneath the temple of Apollo there's an [[Sanctuary of Kosmos|ancient chamber]]. I think they meet there. But without one of their cloaks and masks, you won't make it more than two steps inside.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find one of these cloaks and masks?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''There is a man, he visits me from time to time. Makes sure I'm well taken care of. I have the biggest house in the [[Chora of Delphi]], yet he still offers me [[drachma]]e for my troubles. Gives me the creeps.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's his name?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''[[Elpenor]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor! He's with the Cult?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''I can't be sure, but if he is, he would definitely have what you require.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Elpenor is still alive=\n(If Elpenor is alive)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any idea where I can find him?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''There is a [[Pharsalos Fort|fort]] just south of the [[Valley of the Nymph]]. He's been known to conduct business there.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've been helpful.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''May the light of Apollo guide you to your family.''\nor\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Now get out of my house.''\n|-|If Elpenor was tracked down and killed beforehand=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I sent Elpenor to the [[underworld]]. I knew the mask I stripped from his corpse would come in handy.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''May Apollo protect you.''\nor\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Now go. You bring nothing but darkness with you.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra gave a short bow and smile, out of thanks or disdain, and left the Pythia alone.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should tell Herodotos what the Pythia told me about the Cult. Maybe he'll have some insight.''\n[[File:ACOD - The Truth Will Out 2.jpg|thumb|240px|Kassandra meeting with Herodotos]]\nHerodotos, not far away, awaited Kassandra's return from her infiltration.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Well? What did the Pythia tell you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Cult of Kosmos is hunting me. But I'm going to hunt ''them'' first. She told me they meet in a secret chamber under the Temple of Apollo.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''So, it's all true. If the Cult has done anything, it's fool this old man.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Elpenor is alive=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't get in without a mask and cloak. It's how the Cultists identify each other.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''The Temple of Apollo is by the [[Cave of Gaia]]\u2014simple enough to find. But a Cultist's mask and cloak? How will you accomplish that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Pythia gave me the only clue I need. When I'm ready, I'll meet you at the temple. For now, I'm going to kill Elpenor... ''malakas'' liar.''\n|-|If Elpenor was tracked down and killed beforehand=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've killed the first Cultist, Elpenor. A snake I met in [[Kephallonia]]. His mask and cloak will get me inside the chamber.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''So they're underneath the Temple of Apollo... Yes, by the Cave of Gaia. I think I know the place.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Find it, and I'll meet you there.''\n</tabber>\nHerodotus left to prepare for Kassandra's arrival at the chamber entrance.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra interrogated the Pythia and learned the meeting place of the Cult of Kosmos.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "Speaking to the Pythia prior to completing [[The Wolf's Fate]] will immediately fail that quest. [[The Wolf's Helm]] will still be added to the player's inventory as an epic-level helmet.\n\nIf any cult soldier is killed at this location during or even before this quest is active, the Pythia will be interrogated by a [[The Monger|forceful brute]] of a cultist during [[The Serpent's Lair]]. Killing them after completing the quest does not seem to trigger the interrogation.\n*Players seeking to avoid this should knock out enemies rather than kill them, or fire arrows into corners to draw them away from doors. However, recruiting unconscious guards appears to also trigger the interrogation. Detection and fleeing out of sight is also allowed, but the Pythia can only be spoken to while anonymous.\n*For the duration of this quest, a random mercenary may stand guard at the residence alongside the cult soldiers. It is unclear if their demise affects this.{{Cite|14 Aug 2021. Needs confirmation}}",

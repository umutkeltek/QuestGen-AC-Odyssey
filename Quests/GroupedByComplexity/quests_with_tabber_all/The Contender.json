The diet and training is... transformative.''\n*'''Paios:''' ''Obviously...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people came for a show. I'll give them one.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Paios:''' ''This is unprecedented, but the crowd will riot if the pankration is cancelled.<br>Very well. The competition begins shortly.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to go.''\nPaios nodded and led her inside. Kassandra changed into her athletic attire and stepped into the ring, facing her competitor, [[Orion (Olympian)|Orion]].\n<tabber>\n|-|Kallias alive=\n[[File:ACOD The Contender - Kallias and Leander at the Olympics.png|thumb|250px|Leander introducing Kallias]]\n*'''[[Leander]]:''' ''Welcome all, it is my pleasure to introduce to you [[Kallias]].

Kassandra changed back into her normal garb and met with Alkibiades and [[Barnabas]].\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Astounding! To think I could be a companion to an Olympic champion.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''You're even better at sparring than I am\u2014''\nAlkibiades held his fist near his chest, and Barnabas and Kassandra looked at each other with concern.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Though if [[Sokrates]] were a more willing partner...''\n[[File:ACOD The Contender Memory Screenshot 09.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Barnabas tending to Alkibiades]]\nAlkibiades collapsed and retched, and Barnabas and Kassandra tended to him.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Alkibiades, are you all right?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I was... with my friends [[Demophanes]] and Kallias. Respected Olympic judges, no less...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Too much cheap wine?''\nAlkibiades stared at her with uncharacteristic annoyance.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You look like you drank from [[Medea]]'s cup...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Medea's cup? You think he's been poisoned?''\n(If players asked \"Where were you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were... celebrating?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It's the Olympics. What's not to celebrate? We were at the [[Leonidaion]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'm going to find Demophanes.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you've been poisoned, I need to find these judges.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Poisoned? Do you think that they could be too or... No. Never! They're good men you can't think one of them... They host a celebration every Olympics to celebrate the sacred truce.''\nAlkibiades proceeded to vomit. Kassandra turned to Barnabas.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stay with him. I'll find out what happened.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra replaced Testikles in the pankration Olympics. She defeated Orion and Erastos, advancing to the finals against the reigning champion Dorieus. After the event, she met with Alkibiades and Barnabas, the former collapsing and presumed poisoned. Kassandra decided to investigate the celebration he attended.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Kallias can be killed prior to this quest, which in turn will affect Leander's introduction to the pankration event and Kassandra's fights. The intermission is the same, however, and Alkibiades is still poisoned. The dialogue always references Kallias as host of the celebration, which is either an oversight or indicates that he arranged the poisoning to take place with or without him present.\n**As Alkibiades did not collapse until after the opening rounds at the pankration, it is more likely he attended the celebration beforehand and the poison itself was slow acting.",

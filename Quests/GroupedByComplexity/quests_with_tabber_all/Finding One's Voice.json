I'm too old for this.''\n\nMaron stepped aside as Kassandra entered the Temple. After defeating the [[Soldier|guards]], Kassandra visited the Pythia in an inner chamber.\n[[File:ACOD Finding One's Voice 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the Pythia]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There'' might ''be a bit of blood when you go upstairs.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''You again?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here for a different reason.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|If the Pythia was tortured.=\n*'''Pythia:''' ''After last time, [[Cult of Kosmos|they]] tortured me. I thought they were going to kill me just like I told you. It hurt so badly, I begged for death.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't mean for that to happen.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Just hurry and tell me what you want.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's something you need to know. The Cult is dead.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''What do you mean they're dead?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just that. I've killed them all. There's nobody left to control you.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''You may have unmasked those who made the decisions, but the Cult did not die with them. Their beliefs will live on.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then I'll find and kill whoever follows them.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''That is not a possible task. Now, tell me what you want.''\n|-|If the Pythia was not tortured.=\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Why are you here? Be quick.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You told Sokrates something, and I want to know why.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Questioning why the Pythia speaks is a strange thing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know why you speak and I know who controls your voice. Tell me why the Cult had you tell Sokrates he's the wisest.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''The Cult didn't tell me to say that. I did that on my own.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That makes no sense.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Cult wouldn't allow you to do that.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Which is why I was very careful. I seek Sokrates as an ally, but simply asking him to help wouldn't have worked.''\n|-|Threaten \u2013 You're lying.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me the truth, or I'll force you to.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''I gain nothing by lying to you. If you and Sokrates are close, you're my ally in this as well.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''An ally for what?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''I know much of Sokrates. Not only has he visited me often, but his students do as well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get to the point.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''You know the [[Greek mythology|gods]] don't speak through me. I feel Sokrates is the one who can convince others of this. If he succeeds, the Cult will have no more need for me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you're hoping he comes to the conclusion that the gods don't exist.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''It matters not if Sokrates believes they exist. He needs simply to doubt that the gods speak through me.''\n\n(If \"Why did you call Sokrates the wisest?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I understand why you think Sokrates can help, but why tell him he is the wisest?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''He'll delve into what it means to be the wisest. It's my hope he'll conclude he's not, and therefore doubt the words of the gods.''\n\n(If \"Why not just tell him the truth?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you just told him your words aren't from the gods, wouldn't that serve the same purpose... and much quicker?''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Sokrates is not the type to desire the answer so quickly. He'll have more drive when he finds the answer on his own.''\n(Leave \u2013 I have what I need.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is getting... complicated.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Whatever you do, you can't tell Sokrates.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I understand. He has to come to the answer on his own.''\n*'''Pythia:''' ''Exactly. Although if you truly wish to help Sokrates, a student of his came by not long before you. He seemed... distraught.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Distraught?''\n[[File:ACOD Finding One's Voice 3.png|thumb|250px|The Pythia directing Kassandra to the student's location]]\n*'''Pythia:''' ''He was clutching a book tightly to his chest and kept looking over his shoulder. He told me he was going into a tomb nearby until things were safe.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you. I'll find him.''\nKassandra exited the Sanctuary and headed for the [[Tomb of the First Pythia|tomb]].\n*'''Priest:''' ''Please, don't come back here again.''\n[[File:ACOD Finding One's Voice 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding Sokrates' student]]\nShe found the student safe within the tomb.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't need to be scared now. I'm not with them.''\n*'''Student:''' ''That doesn't mean you won't kill me. You just want this for yourself!''\nThe student clutches his parchment closer to him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a friend of Sokrates's.''\n*'''Student:''' ''You are? Prove it!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Sokrates is the smartest man I know.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've never met someone as smart as Sokrates. I always think about our conversations long after they've finished.''\n*'''Student:''' ''You know him, all right. I'm sorry for doubting you.''\n|-|I don't need to prove anything.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not proving anything to you. I just saved your life, and I'm here to help.''\n*'''Student:''' ''OK... If you say so.''\n|-|Sokrates is incredibly annoying.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sokrates is one of the most frustrating people I've ever known. He just talks, talks, and talks and it feels like he asks questions just so he can continue talking, and talking, and talking.''\n*'''Student:''' ''What you call frustrating, I call brilliant. But it's clear you know him well.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why were those men after you?''\n*'''Student:''' ''For some reason, they wanted these writings of Sokrates's. Well, I wrote them, but it's all his words.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That seems like a strange thing to want.''\n*'''Student:''' ''One of them had a big mouth. He mentioned something about the priests at the [[Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia|Sanctuary]] of [[Minerva|Athena Pronaia]]. He said this was the final thing they needed to get rid of Sokrates.''\n\n(If \"What does Sokrates teach his students?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've always been curious. What does Sokrates teach you?''\n*'''Student:''' ''So much. Follow him around for an entire day, and you won't be able to sleep, your mind will be so aflutter with thoughts.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not sure I'd last a whole day with him.''\n\n(If \"What do you like about Sokrates?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What drew you to Sokrates?''\n*'''Student:''' ''I've never met a man like him, and I don't think I ever will again. Every day with him is one worth waking up for.''\n\n(If \"I'll deal with the priests.\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take care of the priests.''\n*'''Student:''' ''Thank you. And... well. Please, give this to Sokrates.''\nThe student gave Kassandra his writings.\n*'''Student:''' ''It hurt me to say this after all I've learned from him, but I have a family. I can't risk being caught up in whatever this is.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you're going to stop being his student?''\n*'''Student:''' ''It feels I have no choice. Maybe one day that will change.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be sure to give him the writings.''\n[[File:ACOD Finding One's Voice 7.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra parting ways with the student]]\n*'''Student:''' ''Thank you. Make sure he stays safe. The world will be a worse place without him in it.''\nKassandra left the student.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That student gave me an idea. [[Xanthippe]] said there was a symposium. Maybe I can convince the others who were there to help Sokrates. I'm not sure why the priests want Sokrates gone, but I need to take care of them.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "The Pythia explained herself to Kassandra and pointed her in the direction to a student of Sokrates' who had gone missing. Kassandra subsequently rescued said student who gave her his parchment of Sokrates' teachings.",

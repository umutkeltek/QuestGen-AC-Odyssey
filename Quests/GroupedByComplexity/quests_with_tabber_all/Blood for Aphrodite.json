[[Thyia]] and her warriors are holding them off, but we need reinforcements.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''As prepared as we're going to be. Go! I'll stay with those who can't fight.''\nKassandra took her leave and followed the villager.\n*'''Villager:''' ''This way! They've got us pinned against the rocks.''\nThey traveled up the path leading up the cliffside and met the enemy at the [[Kephisos Spring]]. While the defenders held their own, Kassandra's presence ultimately turned the tide of battle in their favor and the invaders were slain to the last man. Thyia took some wounds, but was no worse for wear.

Something must have happened.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''I never went inside. I'm not a ''fool''. But [[Nikios]] wanted me to watch the boy.<br />I stayed outside and prayed, but I heard it\u2014the [[Minotaur]].

Though two who did... will never truly escape it.''\n(Asked \"Why won't you talk to Ardos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ardos says you refuse to speak or talk to him about his father.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''How can anyone tell a boy the person he looks up to\u2014his father and only family\u2014is dead?!<br />What I can do in Nikios's honor is to stop his son from entering that cursed place!''\n(Chose \"Tell me what the men want.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would they hurt you?''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''When the survivors fled the Minotaur, they left behind a [[Phaistos Disk|disk]]\u2014the key to the labyrinth... and I kept it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then why do they think Ardos has it?''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''Because he does. He stole it from me. And I told them about it.<br />They tortured me, ''misthios''! I\u2014I tried not to break.<br />I've failed him. I've failed him all these years.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|There's still time to make amends.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people who tortured you belong to a powerful cult.

He doesn't know its true purpose, ''misthios''. With it, you'll be able to open the labyrinth.<br />Just promise to keep him safe.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'll be safe with me.''\nThe old man left towards his home, while Kassandra was left to ponder her next step.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should ask Ardos if the old man is telling the truth.''\nShe also inspected [[Theseus' Greaves|greaves]] she'd recovered.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be a piece of Theseus' armor.

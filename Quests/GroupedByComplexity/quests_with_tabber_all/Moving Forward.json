We've traveled a lot together.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I think it may be time I set off on my own.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I understand.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course. As much as I like you by my side, I can't expect you to stay forever.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I figured I'd take my leave while you still feel that way. It will feel strange, though.''\n|-|I wish you didn't have to go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I knew it'd happen one day. But I wish it didn't have to.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I know. We've been through far more than most people will ever experience in their lives. But, even so, it will be a weird feeling.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will take some getting used to. Well, where should I take you?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''The docks near Athens should do. There are some others I'd like to say goodbye to as well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure they'll be sorry to see you go. To Athens!''\n\nThey set sail for the [[Port of Piraeus]]. After a voyage, they dock at the port, and Kassandra escorted her friend off the ship.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I sometimes pinch myself to make sure that I'm awake and that all we went through truly happened.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With your writings, it won't soon be forgotten either.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''The world will be better knowing. My mind is flooded with the memories of all we experienced.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you have a favorite?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''How could I possibly decide? You opened my eyes to so much. Uncovered so many secrets and mysteries that will change the course of the world. Your [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]] and all it suggests... [[Atlantis]]... The [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]]...''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm amazing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When you start listing everything, you're right... I'm quite amazing.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''And humble!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One of my stronger traits.''\n|-|We did it together.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''None of those things are mine alone to take credit for. You were there through it all.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''How could I ignore what was so clearly in front of me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You couldn't, which is why you have as much of a claim to all we did.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I wonder what the great Eagle Bearer will remember best from this journey?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It's impossible to decide.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's like you said... it's impossible to pick just one.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It feels we met so long ago now, but we've also been through a lot in such a short time.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad you visited the [[Pythia]] that day and saw [[Barnabas]].''\n|-|The symposium.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The symposium won't easily be forgotten.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''No, I'd imagine not.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was overwhelming, but looking back on it now and everyone I met... I'm not sure how I'd put it into words. I guess that will be up to you.''\n|-|Our trip to Samos.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Our trip to [[Samos]] holds a special place in my heart.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Mine as well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you thought of returning?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Not just yet. But I hope my next visit is far more uneventful.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't think you'll have to worry about that.''\n|-|Uncovering Atlantis.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've been through a lot, but I'm not sure anything will ever match Atlantis.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''To think we're some of the only people to know of its existence. Of your [[Pythagoras|true father]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Which you promised you'd keep to yourself!''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Of course, of course!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You may be leaving, but I'll find you if I have to.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I guess this is it. As much as I'll miss our conversations, this is where our paths diverge.''\n(Asked \"Where are you going?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is your path taking you now?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''To {{Wiki|Thurii|Thourioi}}.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's waiting for you there?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''That's the exciting part. I have no idea.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Know what? I'm not sure anyone loves the unknown as much as you.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It only stays that way until someone cares enough to ''make'' it known. In Thourioi, that someone will be me.''\n(Asked \"When will I see you again\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Will I see you again?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Our paths may cross once more, and I hope they do. If that comes to pass, after all, it likely means something big is following close behind.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then I hope our adventures are nowhere near complete.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Goodbye, Herodotos.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've never been great at saying \"goodbye.\"''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''To do so is to impart a sense of finality, and we have no way of knowing if this is truly goodbye.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good luck in your travels, Herodotos. I can't wait to hear what you get yourself into.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I'll share my stories with you so long as you bring some new ones of your own.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can do that.''",

Why so many guards?''\nWhen Kassandra approached two of the guards stepped in her way.\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Let her Pass.''\nKassandra came just in time to witness Amphores cut the throat of a captured human.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ampheres, if this is how you treat humans, I can see why you need so many guards.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''These aren't humans. They are animals. And animals should be in cages.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're the only animal here.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dead bodies of civilians outside. A tortured corpse at your feet. The only animal I see around here is you.''\n|-|You must have your reasons.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure everything you do isn't without reason, but if you didn't call them animals, you might get a better reaction.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''A human did this to me while I slept. When they came to kill me, I survived, but the slaughtered my daughter like an animal. Humans don't act with logic or reason.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good or bad, they are driven by a will to survive.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''A trait we implanted to ensure efficiency. But, that will become a kindled flame of insurrection. You led a rebellion yourself in [[Elysium]], so I know you understand. If we don't act, the city will burn and many more lives will be lost.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't see an army marching on Poseidon.''\nBehind Ampheres one of his guards struggled to drag out the corpse of the human Amphers killed before.\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''This one said they plan to launch an attack. Someone needs to destroy the resistance before that happens.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not a small request. Despite what you think, all humans aren't a threat.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''It is the only path I see. But you are the ''Dikastes''. Only you can choose the correct course of action.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll kill the leaders.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If we find an kill the leaders - the ones spreading the message - the rest will lose interest.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''An interesting theory. Perhaps you're right. If the leaders are removed, the rest may see the error of their opposition.''\n|-|No killing. I'll destroy their supplies.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing people will just make the fire spread faster. If we destroy their supplies and their weapons, they can't oppose the [[Isu]].''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''I admire your optimism, but i fear it will not be enough. However, it's your decision to make.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just leave it to me. I'll send a message they won't forget.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Very well. You'll find the traitorous humans at an abandoned farmstead. Return to me when the situation is resolved''\nKassandra made her way to the nearby farmstead, to take care of the resistance problem.\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra killed the leaders=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With the leaders dead, the resistance is over.''\n|-|If Kassandra destroyed the supplies=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It'll be hard to form a resistance if they have no supplies.''\n</tabber>\nShe returned to Ampheres.\n*'''Ampheres:''' Dikastes'', I'm glad to see you return safely. I almost considered sending a regiment of my guard after you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That would have been overkill.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''You can never be too careful when dealing with violent humans. Come, tell me, has the resistance been quashed?''\n<tabber>\n|-|If the leaders were killed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I killed the leaders.

    "Section_Description": "Deimos approached [[Phidias]] with the objective of extracting information regarding some mysterious symbols on behalf of the [[Cult of Kosmos]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Phidias examined the contents of several scrolls over a marble block in his [[Phidias' Workshop, Olympia|workshop]] at [[Olympia]], expressing discontentment while reading them. Suddenly, Deimos arrived and punched the back of Phidias' head, which bounced off in the block and began to bleed. Phidias fell to the ground and crawled away for his life as Deimos grabbed a chisel from the sculptor's toolset on top of the marble and walked closer.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Are you... [[Brison]]?''\n<tabber>\n|-|\ud83d\udd9d I'm Deimos.=\n*'''Deimos:''' ''The name is Deimos.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''No... I heard you're not real. You're not real.''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''Oh, I'm real. Here, let me show you.''\n|-|\ud83d\udd9d This is going to hurt.=\n*'''Deimos:''' ''No talking until after we dance.''\n|-|\ud83d\udd9d Tell me how you found these symbols.=\n*'''Deimos:''' ''The symbols.

Let's do this the hard way.''\n|-|I don't want to do this.=\nThe memory collapsed and rewound to the moment when Deimos punched Phidias' head due to the subject [[Synchronization|desynchronizing]] with the events.\n</tabber>\nDeimos punched Phidias again, throwing him onto another slab of marble. He then stabbed Phidias' left hand with the tool, causing the artist to scream in pain.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Itira! Korgath! Metin! That's all I know. You have to believe me.''\nDeimos held his hand to his forehead in frustration.\n<tabber>\n|-|\ud83d\udd9d Time to break your other hand.=\n*'''Deimos:''' ''Maybe you'll talk if I break your other hand?''\n|-|\ud83d\udd9d Talk sense, and I'll spare you.=\n*'''Deimos:''' ''I'm not here to hurt you, Phidias. We're friends. I just want to know where these symbols [[Gateway to the Lost City|come from]]. You would tell your friend, wouldn't you?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''It... Itira. Ko...''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''Korgath! Metin! Are you ''trying'' to anger your friend?''\n|-|Please stop this.=\nThe memory collapsed and rewound to the moment Deimos stabbed Phidias' hand due to the subject desynchronizing with the events.\n</tabber>\nDeimos continued to repeatedly and violently punch Phidias until the man's blood ran down the piece of marble. He briefly stopped in a moment of contemplation, during which the refusal of the subject to being ejected from the memory manifested in a protest by Deimos.\n*'''Deimos:''' ''NO!''\nHe then climbed the slab and stood over Phidias.\n*'''Deimos:''' ''Don't be afraid. We all die. But first, tell me what I want to know.''\nDeimos picked up Phidias and threw him across the room. The helpless artist continued to utter the words as an angry Deimos stepped down from the piece of marble and approached him.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Ithira! Korgath! Metin! Ithira! Korgath! Metin! Ithira! Korgath! Metin!''\nThe scene cut to outside of the workshop, from which screams continued to be heard.",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra crossed the border into Arkadia and reminded herself of her meeting point with [[Myrrine]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mater'' told me to meet her at the [[Statue of Artemis in the Cedar]].''\nKassandra crossed Golden Fields of Akardia and remark to herself.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They called Arkadia the \"breadbasket of the Peloponesian League.\" Wheat's the most precious resource in the Greek World...''\nKassandra traveled to a hill at the border of the [[Golden Fields]], upon which sat the statue. She spotted it with the help of [[Ikaros]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There. Will be good to see ''mater'' and Brasidas again.''\n[[File:ACOD To Kill or Not to Kill 1.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra demading Brasidas' location from Sosipatros]]\nShe climbed the hill and encountered the mercenary [[Sosipatros]], instead of Brasidas, at the base of the statue.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who are you?''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Me? I'm no one. But you? You're even godlier than Brasidas said you'd be. It should be your statue between these trees.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Brasidas? What does he have to do with this?''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Warrior, he said! Look for the mighty warrior with the [[Spear of Leonidas|broken spear]]. I added the godly bit.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I am the mighty warrior.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Brasidas knows a warrior when he sees one. Word of my deeds will outlive any statue.''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Of course! Your story should be sung from the mountain tops.

And there's more than one broken spear in this world.''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''And the [[eagle]] he mentioned?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What eagle?''\nIkaros swooped down upon her head and uttered a short call. She grimaced at the eagle's poor timing, if not intentional on his part, and dropped the ruse.\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD To Kill or Not to Kill 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra threatening Sosipatros]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where ''is'' Brasidas? I need to speak with him.''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Of course you do! And the woman, you'd like to speak with her too, yes?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait...''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''She looks like you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where they went.''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''I should. It's what Brasidas paid me for, after all.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then why don't you?''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''He didn't pay enough.''\nSosipatros drew his sword and attacked Kassandra. Kassandra defeated him the same as every opponent she had faced up to that point.\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Stop! Please stop!''\nHe yielded as he dropped to one knee.\n\n(If players chose \"I am the mighty warrior\" earlier)\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''\"My story will outlive any statue.\"<br>Who says that?''\n(If players chose \"I'm just a traveler\" earlier)\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''\"Just a traveler,\" she says.''\n[[File:ACOD To Kill or Not to Kill 5.png|thumb|250px|Sosipatros threatened by Kassandra]]\nRegardless, Kassandra threatened Sosipatros.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where they are, or I'll cut that shit-eating grin off your shit-eating face!''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''He said you had a nasty temper. He wasn't wrong.''\nSosipatros slumped back on the ground.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Help me find my mother.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where my ''mater'' is and you may walk out of here alive.''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''You show mercy.

Show mercy!''\nKassandra drew her spear.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Speak!''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''They're on a hill\u2014a cliff overlooking Tegea.''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|Help me understand.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said Brasidas didn't pay enough. Who did?''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''The [[Lagos|Archon]]. He's paying more for your head than Brasidas could afford in two lifetimes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me who the Archon is. I want a name.''\nSosipatros laughed and stood up.\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Lagos. His name is Lagos. And he's the most powerful man in Arkadia\u2014he who controls the grain, controls the world.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Consider yourself lucky. I've seen enough blood.''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Oh, but you'll be seeing a lot more. Welcome to Arkadia, Kassandra.''\n|-|Threaten \u2013 Tell me who's paying you or die.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Brasidas didn't pay you enough? Who did? Tell me, or I'll wrap your guts around your neck and hang you from that tree!''\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''The [[Lagos|Archon]]. He's paying more for your head than Brasidas could afford in two lifetimes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me who the Archon is. I want a name.''\nSosipatros laughed and stood up.\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''Lagos. His name is Lagos. And he's the most powerful man in Arkadia\u2014he who controls the grain, controls the world.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You threatened the wrong people, ''mal\u00e1ka.\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''I don't threaten, I promise!''\n</tabber>\nIf Kassandra killed Sosipatros, she found a note and a ring on him, as well as [[Sosipatros' Blade|sword]].\n*'''Letter from Brasidas:''' ''I am with your mother. Meet us on the cliff near Tegea. \u2014B''\nAfter deciding whether or not to kill Sosipatros, Kassandra made her way to the cliff overlooking Tegea and finally reunited with [[Myrrine]] and Brasidas. As she entered their encampment, she heard them arguing.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I want the Archon dead.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''None of this makes sense. This isn't the Lagos I know.''\nKassandra approached them.\n[[File:ACOD To Kill or Not to Kill 6.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding Brasidas and Myrrine]]\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Thank the gods you found us.''\nShe nodded at her mother, then turned to Brasidas.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I got your message.''\n(If Sosipatros was killed)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I killed the messenger. He betrayed you, Brasidas.''\n(If Sosipatros was spared)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your messenger is lucky to be alive. He betrayed you, Brasidas.''\nRegardless, Brasidas theorized the reasons behind Lagos' actions.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''These [[Cult of Kosmos|Cultists]] Myrrine told me about\u2014they knew you were coming and must have forced Lagos to place the bounty on your heads. Trusting anyone in Arkadia will be difficult now.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Which is why I say we put that Archon's head on a pike. Our message to the puppet King in Sparta will be clear.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Reason is the answer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's find out more about what's going on in Arkadia. We should be able to solve this Lagos problem without too many beheadings.''\n(If the [[Monger]] was killed publicly)\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''After what happened to the Monger in [[Korinthia]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That crowd wanted blood.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Violence doesn\u2019t always solve problems.''\n(If the Monger was killed quietly)\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Excellent. We need to handle this how you handled the Monger in Korinthia.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll keep that in mind.''\n|-|Violence is the answer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure he has soldiers everywhere in Arkadia... We'll just behead them all.''\n(If the Monger was killed publicly)\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''And deal with it like you dealt with the Monger? Why not hire some musicians to entertain the crowd, too?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you wanted me to kill him in private. But at the time, it was the right choice.''\n(If the Monger was killed quietly)\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''As long as those executions are carried out quietly. Like you did with the Monger in Korinthia.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your advice was good, so I followed it, Brasidas.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Whatever happens, we need Lagos alive. Arkadia is Sparta's breadbasket, and Lagos keeps it full.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''That man is working for the Cult of Kosmos, not Sparta.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Then we need to free him from their grasp.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What makes you think he ''wants'' to leave?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Bounties and threats aren't Lagos' style. He's a farmer, not a killer.''\n(If players asked \"What's your plan, Brasidas?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you have in mind, Brasidas?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Unlike your mother, I think we can handle this quietly. I'm going to begin by investigating a [[Archon's Safe House|safe house]] he keeps. There might be some evidence there.''\n(If players asked \"What's your plan, Myrrine?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you think we should do?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I ''still'' say we send the Archon to Hades. Upsetting Sparta's breadbasket will send the false king searching for crumbs.''\nMyrrine turned to Brasidas.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''The Archon is no longer the man you knew. The Cult has him now.''\n(If players chose \"Enough planning, more doing.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like I came just in time.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You certainly did. But it's time to make a decision.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Your plan is better, Brasidas.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your strategy makes sense, Brasidas.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Thank you. I'm glad you agree.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''You're letting sentimentality cloud your judgment.''\n|-|My mother's plan is better.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My mother's plan is best.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Ah, my lamb. United in blood and purpose.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You're letting your impulses overcome your reason.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Thousands of Spartans depend on Lagos for food and protection. His death would bring chaos.''\n[[File:ACOD_-_Brasidas_warns_Kassandra_about_killing_Lagos.png|thumb|250px|Brasidas discussing with Kassandra about Lagos]]\nBrasidas turned and walked to the cliff's edge to overlook the city of Tegea. Kassandra stepped to his side.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''There's a farmhouse northeast of Tegea where he has a safe house. Meet me there before you do anything you'll regret.''\nBrasidas took his leave of the women and Myrrine took his place at the cliff to speak to Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what if Brasidas' plan doesn't work?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''The Archon hides like a coward in [[Fort Samikon]]. You can't miss that monstrosity. You could go after him now, but be careful\u2014he's well-defended.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then we must weaken his defenses.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''He's got barracks full of [[guard]]s and silos full of grain...<br>It would be a shame if any came to harm.''\n(If players asked \"Where can I find Lagos' guards?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where exactly are Lagos' guards stationed?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Some rest their heads at a [[Tegea Barracks|barracks]] in Tegea. There's also a [[Kepheus Camp|camp]] and a [[Fort of Arkas|fort]] in [[Smuggler's Forest]]. Destroy his guards there, and his defenses will be weakened.''\n(If players asked \"Where are Lagos' silos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where to find the silos.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''The Archon [[Lagos' Compound|stores]] his wheat in [[Pan's Cradle]]. Set the silos alight, and his livelihood will go up in smoke.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Time to go to work.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go see what Lagos is up to.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Good luck, my lamb.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra reunited with Myrrine and Brasidas and unveiled Lagos as a member of the [[Peloponnesian League (Cult of Kosmos)|Peloponnesian League]] branch of the Cult of Kosmos.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*The player can find and reunite with Myrrine and Brasidas at the cliff without going anywhere near the Statue of Artemis in the Cedar. The protagonist will simply say \"I got your message,\" even though they did not encounter Sosipatros and make no mention of his fate. Brasidas' responses are the same for all scenarios.\n*Sosipatros' line describing Lagos, \"He who controls the grain, controls the world\", is reminiscent of \"He who controls the Spice, controls the Universe\", a catchphrase from the 1984  {{Wiki|Dune (1984 film)|film adaptation}} of Frank Herbert's ''{{Wiki|Dune (novel)|Dune}}'' novel.",

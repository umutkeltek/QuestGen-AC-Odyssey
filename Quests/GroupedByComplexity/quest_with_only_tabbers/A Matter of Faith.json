    "Section_Dialogue": "After taking her leave, she went to go ask around. She went to Heriphile, who was pacing.\n\n*'''Heriphile:''' ''Eagle Bearer. What did I do to offend you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing. I just want to know if you saw what happened to the girl, Myrto?''\n*'''Heriphile:''' ''I saw the girl steal a taste of food for your feast. And she fell ill.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She tasted it?''\n*'''Heriphile:''' ''Yes! I'm sorry! Please don't punish me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What? No, of course not.''\n\n(If players try to talk to her again.)\n\n*'''Heriphile:''' ''Please, I told you all I knew about the girl stealing a bite of your feast!''\n\nShe found Chalkippe next.\n\n*'''Chalkippe:''' ''Oh! Eagle Bearer! Do not curse me with your anger!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What? Why would I curse you?''\n*'''Chalkippe:''' ''Your anger is well-storied! We seek only to please you, unlike that disrespectful waif, Myrto.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did Myrto do?''\n*'''Chalkippe:''' ''I couldn't say! I only know that Hexione called Myrto a wrongdoer and said you had punished her for her transgressions as a warning to us all.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That is ridiculous! I need to find Hexione.''\n\n(If players try to talk to her again.)\n\n*'''Chalkippe:''' ''Your greatness, we will all try to do better! So you will not visit your wrath upon us as you did upon Myrto.''\n\nShe went over to a man nearby,\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Grayhair, where can I find the Priestess Hexione? You must know.''\n*'''Hevmonos:''' ''The priestess and her sisters have a secluded retreat. None know where it is, for it is hidden from common eyes. I cannot say more for risk of offending them, or you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those women do not speak for me. Tell me now or I'll get angry...''\n*'''Hevmonos:''' ''Yes! Yes! They appear from and retreat to a secret den, past the border to Elis.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to have words.''\n\nShe found the cave on the Arkadia/Elis border. Inside, the sisters gathered together.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hexione! Why did you flee from the village?''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''I left to consult with my sisters. We needed to understand why the poor girl was struck down.''\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''Did Linou offend the divine Eagle Bearer somehow?''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''Or are we being tested by greater powers of Olumpos?''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Are the gods testing our faith... or yours?''\n\n<Tabber>\n|-|Don't tempt my wrath. Speak plainly.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do not speak in riddles! Tell me what you mean, or face my anger.''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Wrathful Eagle Bearer, we want only what you want!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want to know what happened to Myrto and how to help her.''\n|-|Mo more games. I just want to help Myrto.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't want to play games. Please, tell me what you know so I can save Myrto.''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Of course, beloved Eagle Bearer. We want the same.''\n\n</Tabber>\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''We prayed for an answer, and it was delivered!''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''In the sacred cave there is a plant that can save her. But it is too dangerous for us mere mortals to descend into.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go get it.''\n\n(If players talk to them again.)\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''Brave Eagle Bearer, your path leads you to the sacred cave.''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''Fierce Eagle Bearer, the answers you seek are there!''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Divine Eagle Bearer, find the truth!''\n\nShe traveled deeper in the cave, where she saw something unexpected.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By Zeus, that's a beast!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The priestesses expect me to become bear shit? ''Mal\u00e1kes''. First the bear, then the plant.''\n\nShe slays the beast after a brutal battle.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I get the feeling the priestesses were hoping for a martyred god and not a pissed off ''misthios''.''\n\nShe found the plant.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got it... wait, this plant is nothing but pig feed! It won't do anything! ''Mal\u00e1ka''!''\n\nAs she got closer to the sisters, she overheard them.\n\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''I told you we should have focused our prayers around a foreign spirit!''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Sew your mouths shut, the two of you! As soon as the divine bear eats the Eagle Bearer's heart, we'll have nothing to wprry about!''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''I haven't heard anything from below for awhile now...''\n\nShe walked up to them.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hexione! I killed your bear.''\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''You're here!''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''You're alive!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Very much so. And angry. You better have an antidote for poor Myrto, or else...''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Or what?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You risk a curse to make all of Olympos tremble.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You used my name to try to control the village, and when I arrived you poisoned Myrto and then tried to have me eaten by a bear.''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''No! Never!''\n\n\nPriestess Thelxiope got onto her knees.\n\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''Yes! It's all true!''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Shut your mouth, you insipid...''\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give me the antidote, Hexione, before I turn you all into slugs and bury you in salt.''\n\nHexione handed her the antidote.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. Now, return the wealth you've stolen to the village or I'll make you wish you'd pissed off [[Hera]] instead of me.''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''No! Eagle Bearer! As you command!''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''At once!''\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''We obey!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go. Do. It!''\n\n|-|I'll show you a world of earthly pain.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shut your lying, filthy mouths! You poisoned Myrto to try to hurt me, and then when I found you, you tried to feed me to a cursed bear!''\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''Yes!''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''No!''\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''We didn't mean it!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Didn't mean it?! You lying ''mal\u00e1kes'', you've got Linou wrapped around your fingers and you're living fat off the villagers in my name!''\n*'''Priestess Xenokleia:''' ''It's true!''\n*'''Priestess Thelxiope:''' ''So true, your divinity!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not a god, you thieving swine! Give me the antidote for Myrto or I'll split your heads open!''\n\nHexione handed her the antidote.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now, begone!''\n\n</tabber>\n\nWith the new revelation, she returns to the village.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have the medicine for Myrto. Quick, let's give it to her.''\n\nThey gave her the antidote, and waited. After awhile, Myrto came to.\n\n*'''Myrto:''' ''Kassandra?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shh. Rest.''\n*'''Polykleitos:''' ''You did it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was close.''\n*'''Polykleitos:''' ''You need to talk to the villagers.''\n\nShe followed him outside, where a large crowd awaited.\n\n<Tabber>\n|-|I, in my glory, give you my blessing for the future.=\n\n(This likely depends on choices made.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Listen and obey me. I want glory for you!''\n*'''Menalkas:''' ''Don't listen to her. She ruined my crops and made Myrto sick. She's just as bad as the priestesses. She's no real god!''\n*'''Hevmonos:''' ''Get out of here, ''misthios''!''\n*'''Akatos:''' ''I cannot thank you enough for saving my daughter, but it may be best if you left?''\n*'''Kallistratos:''' ''Tear the statue down to rubble. We don't want chicken-killers like you here!''\n\nKassandra found herself at the edge of the village, with the crowd staring at her. She turned and walked away.\n\n|-|I know what you want to believe, but I'm not a god.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Look inside yourselves. You'll know that I'm no god and you can live for yourselves.''\n*'''Akatos:''' ''Mabe you're right. Still, you saved my daughter. I'll never forget that.''\n*'''Menalkas:''' ''Thank you, Eagle Bearer, for giving us the courage to stand on our own!''\n*'''Polykleitos:''' ''When I eventually finish your statue, it will be a reminder to the village of your message, and a guide for them to do for themselves.''\n</Tabber>\n\n(After the mission, if players talk to\u00a0Polykleitos.)\n\n*'''Polykleitos:''' ''You showed immense strength of character in helping the people of Linou and not taking the easy route with them, Kassandra. I hope to capture something of your nobility in the final form, however long it takes.''\n(If players speak with Myrto again.)\n*'''Myrto:''' ''It is good to know that we can choose our own paths, no matter what the gods want. I hope to be as brave as you when I get older.''\n(If players speak with Menalkas again.)\n*'''Menalkas:''' ''I pray to [[Demeter]] regularly, and she constantly speaks to me in my dreams, telling me how happy she is now.''\n(Players can return to the cave and speak with\u00a0Hexione as well.)\n*'''Priestess Hexione:''' ''Eagle Bearer! You found me! I have done all you commanded and never returned to Linou. In truth, I have rededicated myself to the gods and try to live a life you would be pleased with.''",

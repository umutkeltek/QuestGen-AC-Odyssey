A secret no one can fathom.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Yes, but a lost world?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It's perfectly possible\u2014Atlantis may exist.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Sounds like hooey to me. But he's insistent about it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Herodotos is right. Atlantis exists.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Incredible!''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I-it's true? I can't believe it. Tell me everything!''\n<tabber>\n|-|It's a long story.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll tell you some day. It's too complicated for small talk.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''It's not me, is it? I've proven I'm very competent!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm exhausted, Barnabas.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Ignore him. When you're ready, I'm all ears.

That's unthinkable\u2014it would make him immortal.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He had a [[Staff of Hermes Trismegistus|staff]] that belonged to the [[Isu|Ancient Civilization]].''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It kept him alive all this time... Makes perfect sense.''\nBarnabas was excited by the news.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Well, where is he? Invite him along\u2014he's your father after all.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He was a stubborn man. He wanted to keep all the knowledge of Atlantis to himself.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Huh, stubborn. I suppose that trait runs in the family.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''He means he's sorry for your loss.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's all right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But none of this can ''ever'' pass your lips. This stays between us.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You have my word.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''But the world needs to know! We could tell the most ''amazing'' tale of our time.''\nKassandra crossed her arms.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Herodotos...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Oh, fine.''\nHerodotos sulked and walked away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then it's settled. Let's move forward.''\nHerodotos turned back and smiled.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Like always.''\nThe sun dropped lower in the sky as they reached the beach where the ''[[Adrestia]]'' was anchored. They continued to reminisce on their adventures thus far while looking at the ship and the sunset.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''We've learned a lot, haven't we, you know-it-all?''\nBarnabas tittered at his own jape.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Speak for yourself\u2014I'm on the hunt for truth. Gods know not all ''your'' myths are accurate.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''They come from the [[Twelve Gods|gods]] themselves, who are the most reliable sources we have.''\n<tabber>\n|-|All things are possible.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For all we know, anything's possible.''\n|-|You're both right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've both been a great help to me. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.''\n</tabber>\nRegardless, Barnabas agreed sportively.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''And you would know, as the [[eagle]]-bearing [[Hybrid|demi-god]] you are.''\nHerodotos played along.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Perhaps she, too, is immortal.''\nKassandra laughed nervously.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sure I am.''\nHerodotos moved closer to her.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I do know one thing for certain. This has been an odyssey I won't forget.''\nShe turned to him, smiled, and they clasped forearms. They all conversed for a little longer before setting off on their next adventure.",

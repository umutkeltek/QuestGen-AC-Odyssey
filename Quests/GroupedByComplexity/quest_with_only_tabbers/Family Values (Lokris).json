You should listen to your gut.''\nSupideo let out a groan.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you doing?''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Listening to my gut. And it's telling me my parents will suffer if you don't help me.''\n|-|The Oracle speaks for the gods.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, the Oracle does speak on behalf of the gods. If she says mater will bleed and pater will scream, then it's wise you've locked yourself up.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''You see! The ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]'' agrees with me.''\n*'''Katina:''' ''Oh Supideo, you believe complete strangers before your own parents.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Not just strangers, mater!

Me and the ''misthios'' are talking. [[Family Sword|My sword]] and [[Supideo's shield|shield]]! Gifts from ''mater'' and ''pater''. We must return them to my parents so they can defend themselves from my ferocious temper.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 I'll get the sword and shield.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, Supideo. I'll get these weapons for you, for a price.''\n|-|I won't help you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your parents will have to defend themselves without the [[sword]] and [[shield]] for now.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''But the prophecy, ''misthios''! What about the prophecy?!''\nKassandra left Supideo and his parents, only to change her mind and return later.\n*'''Supideo:''' Misthios''! Have you changed your mind? Will you bring the sword and shield to my parents? It's the only way to stop the prophecy!''\n(Return to first dialogue option.)\n</tabber>\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Of course! My parents will gladly pay you for your troubles.''\n[[File:ACOD Family Values 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra agreeing to help Supideo]]\n*'''Katina:''' ''What?!''\n*'''Pedasos:''' ''What?!''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Seek out [[Kosta]], the village [[blacksmith]]. I brought him the sword to be sharpened not too long ago.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And the shield?''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''This will be trickier. I'll explain when you return from the blacksmith.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can't wait.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''You mustn't free me! These ropes are the only thing between my parents and my wrath! Please, ''misthios''! Go see the blacksmith and get me my sword.''\nKassandra headed to the village blacksmith.\n*'''Kosta:''' ''[[Aphrodite]] on earth! Umm... er... My name's Kosta, at your service.''\n[[File:ACOD Family Values 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the blacksmith]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Whatever you need, name it, it's yours. I could bend some metal for you, oil those rippling muscles... Fix that [[Spear of Leonidas|broken spear]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for a sword. Belongs to Supideo.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Ah, Supideo. Love that boy. Bit on the thin side if you ask me. His parents feed him nothing!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, well, he needs his sword back.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''And I'd love to give it to you. His sword, I mean. But, I can't just hand over swords to every gorgeous warrior who walks by.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I'll make it worth your while.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give me the sword, and I'll make this a day you'll never forget.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Oh! Um... I... just... That would make every dream I've ever had come true. There's just one tiny problem. You see, my \"spear\" is also broken, if you catch my meaning.''\n|-|Just give me the sword.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just give me the sword, or I'll make this a day you'll never forget.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Oh! I... there's no need to get all heated. Tell you what. I'm drinking wine with someone special tonight, and I'd really like to... make a good impression. My \"spear\" is also broken.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shame.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''But! There are [[Poppy|special flowers]] in the forest beyond the [[Xerxes Military Fort]]. Planted by Aphrodite herself. They really help to... um... re-forge, if you know what I mean.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine. I'll get the flowers, and you'll give me the spear. I mean sword. I mean... don't go anywhere.''\n[[File:ACOD Family Values 7.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra recovering the flowers]]\nKassandra headed to the forest near the Xerxes Military Fort. She found and recovered five of the flowers of Aphrodite mentioned by Kosta.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That should be enough to stoke the blacksmith's flame.''\nAfter doing so, she returned to the blacksmith.\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Gorgeous ''misthios''! You take my breath away! Did you bring the flowers?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can't even go flower picking without some [[Bear|beast]] trying to kill me. But yes, I have them.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra flirted with Kosta earlier=\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Perfect! So, do you mean what you said, about making this a day I'd never forget?''\n|-|If Kassandra did not flirt with Kosta earlier=\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Perfect. These will make tonight a night to remember!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm very happy for you. Now, what you promised.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Of course, of course. Umm, I was just wondering, since you're here. What if I took the flowers now? There's a clean spot in my shop where we could...''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt \u2013 Let's do it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough talking. Eat your plants.''\nKassandra and Kosta had a moment of romance. Afterwards, they returned to their spot.\n*'''Kosta:''' ''That was incredible!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank Aphrodite.''\nKosta laughed.\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Thank all the gods! Here. As promised. I'll never forget you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No. You won't.''\n|-|Leave \u2013 I'm not interested.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm only here for the sword. I did what you asked. Now hand it over.''\n*'''Kosta:''' ''You break my heart, ''misthios''! But I'll make good use of these flowers. Here's the sword. As promised.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should get this back to Supideo's parents before he does anything ''stupideo''.''\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to Kosta once more.\n*'''Kosta:''' ''Oh beautiful ''misthios''. If only I had more Aphrodite flowers.''\n[[File:ACOD Family Values 8.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra returning to Supideo]]\nKassandra returned to the caged Supideo.\n*'''Supideo:''' Misthios'', you've returned! Did you bring the sword?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Thank the gods! I knew I could count on you! But this is only one of the items I needed, and I have two parents.''\n{{-}}",

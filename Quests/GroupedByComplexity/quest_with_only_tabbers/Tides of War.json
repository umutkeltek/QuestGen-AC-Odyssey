Then you can end the Tempest and avenge my husband.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Your husband will be avenged.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll end the Tempest with or without your husband's weapon.

But I'll try.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Parmys:''' ''He would be happy to hear that.''\n(Asked \"Where are the ships?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There plenty of ships in Achaia. What should I look for?''\n*'''Parmys:''' ''The Tempest's ships patrolling the harbor will be a good place to start.''\n(Asked \"Where is the shipyard?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said some of the code books are in the shipyard.

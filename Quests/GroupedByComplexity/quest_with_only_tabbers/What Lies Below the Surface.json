    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra walked over to two warrior brothers, [[Ankos]] and [[Araxis]], who appeared ready to slay a Minotaur.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you must be... the \"warriors.\"''\n*'''Ankos:''' ''Look, brother\u2014the final member of our Minotaur-hunting party has arrived!<br />When the beast sees our assembled might, he will moo miserably in fear!<br />...Do Minotaurs moo, or... ?''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''If it's all right with both of you, I'd like to strike the killing blow.<br />Or, can we at least ''say'' I struck the killing blow? ...I'm willing to haggle down to \"played a key role in distracting the Minotaur while allowing the killing blow to be struck.\"''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|The killing blow will be mine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Minotaur is a mythical creature\u2014only someone just as mythical could slay it.''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''...You're talking about me, right?''\n*'''Ankos:''' ''The only \"myths\" about you, little brother, are the ones ''pater'' paid to keep quiet.''\n|-|Any one of us could kill him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The killing blow will go to the warrior with the greatest skill and courage in battle.''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Then I shall wear the Minotaur's entrails as my necklace!''\n</tabber>\nKassandra sighed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This can only end well.''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Are you ready to ride?''\n\n(Accept \u2013 \"Let's go.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's slay a Minotaur.''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''[[Leiandros]] says it lives in the [[Cave of the Brave]], on the [[Dikte Plateau]]. I say let the Mino-tournament BEGIN!''\n\nThey mounted their [[horse]]s and rode out of [[Warrior's Rest]], chatting.\n*'''Araxis:''' ''...If the Minotaur eats humans ''and'' lives right next to the population of [[Pephka]], how are they all still alive?''\n*'''Ankos:''' ''Perhaps the diet of Pephkans disagrees with him?''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Good thinking, brother! Let us dip our blades in rich oils and onions to gain an edge in combat!''\nThey rode through [[Death Gorge]] to the Cave of the Brave.\n*'''Ankos:''' ''Behold, brother; the home of the Minotaur!''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Isn't he supposed to live in a [[Labyrinth of Lost Souls|labyrinth]]?''\n*'''Ankos:''' ''That's a myth.''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Isn't the ''Minotaur'' a myth?''\n*'''Ankos:''' ''No, he's the half-[[Cattle|bull]], half-[[human]] bastard son of King [[Minos]]' [[Pasiphae|wife]].''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''...Sounds like a myth to me.''\nThey dismounted near the entrance to the cave.\n*'''Araxis:''' ''I hear the Minotaur was slain by [[Theseus]].''\n*'''Ankos:''' ''Impossible! If Theseus killed the Minotaur, how can it be here?''\nThey walked to the cave entrance.\n*'''Ankos:''' ''BEWARE BEAST! For soon I shall use your spinal column as as an eating utensil!''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Don't warn him.''\nAs if in reply, they heard a roar.\n*'''Unknown:''' ROOOOOOOOAR!!!\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ominous. Must be in the right place.''\nThe three entered the cave, and Ankos was immediately overcome by cowardice.\n*'''Ankos:''' ''There's no glory here... only death.''\nA voice roared out at them from the depths of the cave again.\n*'''Unknown:''' ROOOOOOOOAR!!!\nAnkos turned tail and ran out of the cave.\n*'''Ankos:''' ''No-no-no! I only ever wanted to be a baker!''\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Brother! Wait! There's more glory in beast-slaying that ''[sic]'' in bread-making!''\nKassandra and Araxis continued, until the voice roared again.\n*'''Unknown:''' ROOOOOOOOAR!!!\nAraxis turned tail and ran out of the cave.\n*'''Araxis:''' ''Uh, I should check on my brother. The baking business is fierce, you know!<br />Good luuuuuuck!''\nKassandra let out an annoyed grunt.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pephka, home of heroes.''\nKassandra continued onward with enough courage for all of Pephka. She spied the pit at the bottom full of corpses and some [[snake]]s, which she killed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever lives down here ''must'' be a monster.''\nShe inspected the bodies more carefully.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These bodies haven't been torn apart by a Minotaur, they've been... arranged?<br />These bodies have arrow wounds and cuts from weapons too small to be wielded by a Minotaur.''\nShe continued onward and heard the roar again.\n*'''Unknown:''' ROOOOOOOOOAR...!\nThe roar ended in coughing.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did the Minotaur just... cough?''\n*'''Unknown:''' ''This is your last chance to flee, mortal!''\nKassandra, unimpressed, continued into the chamber. She placed her hands on her hips as the man-sized Minotaur presented himself.\n*'''Unknown:''' ''I. Am... The Minotaur!'' Roooooooar!!!\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''...What?''\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Drop all your valuables and flee in terror, mortal!<br />L-leave me your [[drachma]]e and you shall be spared! otherwise, DEATH BY HOOF AWAITS YOU!''\nKassandra stepped forward with a raised eyebrow.\n*'''Unknown:''' FEAR MY MOO!!!'' ...Fear it?''\nThree bandits appeared from the side to confront Kassandra. At this point, she'd had enough.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''... I'm going to start stabbing until someone tells me what's going on!''\n\nShe engaged the bandits as the Minotaur called out to her.\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Don't kill me, don't kill me, don't kill me!<br />[[Cult of Kosmos|They]] made me do it! Their masks are even scarier than mine!<br />It's worth it... it's worth it... I-I'm not a bad man...''\nKassandra finished killing the bandits and made her way to the \"Minotaur.\"\n\n<tabber>\n|-|If the Minotaur slain=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The last Minotaur I killed talked less.''\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Killed?! No, uh\u2014we don't have to use the \"K\" word! I mean, grrr!''\n\n|-|If the Minotaur alive=\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Please, no\u2014they made me! Don't kill me!''\nShe spoke to him. He tried in vain to scare her off.\n*'''Unknown:''' ...Grr!'' I said GRRR!!!<br>Oh, fuck it. Hi.''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me what's going on.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no need for more blood. Just keep your horns away from me, and tell me what's going on here.<br>You can take off that mask.''\n|-|Threaten \u2013 Talk or bleed.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me what's going on, or I'll cut it out of you. And take off that ''mal\u00e1kas'' mask.''\n</tabber>\nThe \"Minotaur\" took off his mask to reveal a familiar face.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leiandros?!''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I told you nothing is what it seems in Pephka!<br />I'm happy to refund any expenses incurred\u2014''\nKassandra crossed her arms.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Please, it's my daughter, [[Amara]]! Masked men are holding her captive deep in the canyons of Dikte Plateau.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Masked men.\" What kind of masks?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Uh, uh\u2014white like marble, bleeding from their eyes. Horrific.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Cult.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''They control everything in Pephka... lure champions from all over with the promise of Minotaur-slaying glory, only to swindle and ambush them down here in the dark. Honorless.<br />If I don't do as they say, Amara dies. If I take off my mask, or tell my [[Kore|wife]], or ask for help... she dies.''\n(If \"What can you tell me about Amara?\" is chosen)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me about your daughter.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Amara... the sound of her laughter is [[sun]]light on my skin. She is joy, ''misthios.<br />''...One night the Masked Men took that joy from me. They needed my silver tongue to lure wealthy warriors to their Trials.<br />In Amara, they found all they needed to control me.''\n(If \"Where exactly is Amara?\" is chosen)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said the Cult\u2014the \"masked men\" have your daughter in the canyons of Dikte Plateau\u2014\u2014<br />There are a lot of canyons.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''But only one holds Amara. There's a place called [[Zakros]]\u2014an ancient ruin, and a bastion of the masked men's power. I go there every night, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.<br />But I never have. I fear they keep her underground, where she'll never see the sun.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I've heard enough.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How many men have you sent to their deaths with a speech and a smile?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Thousands. More. But their lives will ''never'' outweigh my Amara.<br />She's all I have... but now I have you, don't I? You... you can free her from those ''mal\u00e1kes'' masked men!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You can still be brave.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me, whose face would Amara wish to see rescue her? Mine? ...Or her father's? ''Be brave'', Leiandros.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Bravery. Yes. You're right, ''misthios''. No matter what, I must be there for my Amara. Please, will you join me?''\n|-|You're a coward.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's your daughter. You must save her!''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''But they'd cut me down! You think she would want to see her father die?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She would want her father to protect her!''\nKassandra spat on him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Coward.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''You're right. I'm a coward. And a man cannot be any more than he is. That's enough for me, but... it's not enough to save Amara. For that, I'll need your help.''\n</tabber>\n\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll stand with you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We will save your daughter... together.''\nLeiandros put his mask back on.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''. Meet me outside the ruins of Zakros on Dikte Plateau. That's where my daughter is, and where I must be.''",

I hear about everything that happens in this [[Athens|city]], ''misthios.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With flattery like that, how could I possibly turn you down?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I'm not trying to flatter you. I'm trying to hire you. I need some [[Sparta]]n military targets... removed.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You want me to do your dirty work.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think you may have the wrong idea about me, General...?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Demosthenes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not a murderer, if that's what you expected.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I expected you were someone who wants to get paid. Was I wrong?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No... not completely. Fine. What do you want?''\n|-|I'm glad to hear your offer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you, if I can. Depending on what it is you need, General...''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Demosthenes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Very good.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''My spies tell me the Spartans are mobilizing. What I want you to do is hamstring them. Get into their forts and remove the [[Polemarch|commanders]] in charge.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I guess that makes sense.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I'm thrilled you approve. You'll need to bring me the seals of the commanders you kill, as proof. You'll be amply rewarded.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those don't seem like standard Athenian tactics.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''They're not. But it will work, and that's what matters. We've already lost too many Athenians to those savages using \"traditional\" warfare. The other generals disagree, but I refuse to let them destroy our chances.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do they want to do?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''They want \"honorable\" face-to-face warfare, pitting our forces directly against the Spartans. We're not going to win a contest of strength against those brutes. We need to outthink them. So, will you kill the commanders?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. I'll take the job.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Good. I might not have approval to deploy our men to do this, but I'm not about to let that stop me.''\n<tabber>\n|-|What's so important about the seals?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's so special about these seals?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Only elite Spartan commanders carry these seals, those in charge of entire forts. They'd all die before parting with them. So bring me the seals as proof that they're dead.''\n|-|Where can I find them?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find them?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''The Spartans have been making inroads into the Athenian territory, taking over forts that once belonged to us. Make them pay for every inch.''\n|-|What's your plan?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's your strategy?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Whatever it takes to protect Athenians lives and kill Spartans.''\n*'''Kasssandra:''' ''That's not what I meant. What's your personal strategy?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''My career is none of your business. Know that I don't seek much. Only proper recognition of my strategic brillance.''\n</tabber>\n(Leave - \"I know enough.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've told me enough. I'll get your seals for you, General.''\nKassandra finished the task eventually and returned to\u00a0Demosthenes.\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Do you have my seals yet?''\n<tabber>\n|-|You doubted me?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course I do. It was easy.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''How could I have doubted your greatness? Nonetheless, I appreciate the work you've done. Would you be interested in another job?''\n|-|I do.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes. I have the seals for you.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''This will show those idiots in the assembly. We're making progress. Interested in getting rid of more polemarchs for me?''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|I could go after more polemarchs.=\n*'''Kassandra:'''\u00a0''I'm interested.''\n|-|Not at the moment.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You get started on the Spartans. I have other things to do right now.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I'm impressed with your work.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did you expect any less?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I had hoped, but hiring you was a gamble.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Most things in life are.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I am perhaps a bit more willing to gamble than my fellow generals would like.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you take no risks, you win no wars.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Exactly!\u00a0How is it a mercenary understands this when the \"greatest\" generals of Athens don't?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not sure whether I should feel flattered or insulted.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''The Spartans are trying to find our supply lines. We've caught several spies already. We cannot afford such a loss.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not if you want to keep your troops alive, no.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''I need you to kill more of their commanders. Leave their [[hoplite]]s without leadership. They'll be scrambling.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you sure? Spartans are fierce warriors.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''Warriors, yes. Thinkers, no. They react like wild animals. Put them in a situation that requires genuine thought, and\u00a0they fall apart. Kill the commanders and bring me their seals. We'll see how the other generals react to''that.\n\n(Dialogue continues to start the next quest.)",

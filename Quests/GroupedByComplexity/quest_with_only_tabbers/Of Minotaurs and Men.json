    "Section_Description": "Within the ruined [[Knossos Palace]], Kassandra found a makeshift camp and investigated it, making the acquaintance of a young boy, [[Ardos]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra agreed to find Ardos' father, [[Nikios]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Minotaur will die, and I will find your ''pater.\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''! No one ever believes me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just calm down and take me to the labyrinth.<br />What's your name?''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Ardos!<br />Now, follow me! The entrance is way down underground.''\nArdos took off into the depths of the ruins, with Kassandra following him as Ardos chattered away.\n*'''Ardos:''' ''It's down this way!<br />This place is going to blow your mind, ''misthios''. There's a ''hugeeeeee'' room and there's a ''hugeeeeee'' hole in the ground with a ''hugeeeeee'' door.<br />Everybody keeps going on about how - [[Theseus]] killed the Minotaur.<br />Lies! I heard it! A roar, like\u2014like uh\u2014<br />Rolling thunder!<br />Yeah, that's it.''\nDeeper and deeper they went.\n*'''Ardos:''' ''The Minotaur is still alive! And hungry!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Great.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''I'm glad you came along. Now ''pater'' has a shot of getting out of that damn labyrinth.''\nBehind a broken wall, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] architecture gave way to something built way [[Isu|earlier]].\n*'''Ardos:''' ''They really didn't have to put the entrance this deep. Almost there. What were these Minoans thinking?<br />Here we are!''\nKassandra followed Ardos into a huge hall. The boy beamed with excitement.\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Isn't this ''amaaaaaazing?!\nKassandra beheld the gate to the labyrinth, the stele before it.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I've never seen anything like this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've seen some things, Ardos. But this...''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''IS AMAAAAAAAAAZING.''\n|-|This isn't special.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's just a ruined door.<br>A big door, sure.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''No, it's not! It's a really - a -<br>S-Stop ruining everything!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So the Minotaur lies beneath Knossos Palace...''\nShe turned to Ardos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Open the door. I've got a minotaur to slay.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Ah. Uh, right.<br />It's locked.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|We'll find a way in.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry, we'll find a way. You must know ''something.\n|-|You're kidding me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you don't know how to get in there, I swear -''\n</tabber>\n*'''Ardos:''' ''I don't! But the guys who went into the labyrinth with my ''pater'' will! I've tried talking to them but\u2014<br />But they won't speak to me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They'll speak to me. Who are these people?''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''The [[Collector]], [[Swordfish]], and my old [[caretaker]].<br />My old caretaker\u2014<br />Boooooooring old man\u2014<br />Never wanted to talk to me about my ''pater'' of the Minotaur, so I left him to find out the truth on my own.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bold.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''And the Collector is this guy who buys weird stuff. He's a [[merchant]] in [[Gortyn]].''\nArdos looked out over the hall.\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Oh! And the last guy! They call him\u2014Swooooooordfish.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''He's the boss of [[Octopus Bay]]. And he's mean.''\nWith that, Ardos turned and left. Kassandra followed him back to his camp and spoke to him.<br>\n(Asked \"How will I find \"Swordfish\"?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where should I start looking for \"Swordfish\"?''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''...[[Fisherman's Beachhead]] in [[Heraklion]] would be your best bet. No one's seen him in years. Some think he's dead.''\n(-> \"Why do people call him \"Swordfish\"?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' \"Swordfish\"''? He must have a long, pointy nose.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''No, no! He's really good with a sword and...<br />He's really good with fish? I guess?''\n(\"Where is the \"Collector\"?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This \"Collector,\" where is he?''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''He lives in Gortyn near some red pillars, in a craaaaaazy house with lots of stuff!<br />I've \"borrowed\" some trinkets from him. He has so many he never even noticed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't let me catch you \"borrowing\" from me.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''From you? I would never!<br />...Get caught.''\n(\"Where is this caretaker of yours?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me more about this old man.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Okay, so, my old caretaker recently sent me a message about wanting to meet in [[Phaistos Village|Phaistos]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's nice of him.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Ha! He never answered me about my ''pater'' or the Minotaur, ever. That's why I left in the first place!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go in your place and see what I find.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''The message said to meet him at our old [[Ardos' House|house]] northeast of here, near Phaistos.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll talk to them.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll make sure they all talk.''\n\nKassandra made good on her word, and sought out the [[Recollections|collector]], [[Blood in the Water (Odyssey)|Swordfish]], and Ardos' [[Full Circle|caretaker]]. Along the way, she found pieces of [[Theseus Set|armor]] said to have belonged to Theseus himself.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra completed her investigation of the men who accompanied Nikios into the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. In doing so, she determined that Ardos unknowingly held the key all along.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*The quest title may be a reference to ''{{Wiki|Of Mice and Men}}'' by John Steinbeck.\n*Ardos says his old house is \"northeast, near Phaistos.\" It's rather west of Knossos Palace, the place where he is at the moment, though it is northeast of Phaistos Village.\n*Despite this quest leading to three support quests, only [[Full Circle]] is required to progress onto [[Seeking Answers]].",

Another time, perhaps.''\nXenia, happy, punched a solid fist in the air as Kassandra returned.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''You're back. Good.

What would he offer the gods, and why?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''The why is unimportant. Perhaps he asks the gods to make his [[drachma]]e multiply, or to harden his cock.''\nKassandra laughed.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''But the offering is said to be crafted golden bracelet, as beautiful as [[Aphrodite]], with workmanship to rival that of [[Hephaistos]]. It would look better on my wrist than on an altar.''\n(If players choose \"Where are the sacred sites?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, how far do I have to travel to find these sacred sites?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''I had one of my loyal crew, [[Anaximander]], draw several maps to show you the locations. He's clever with a stylus.''\n(If players choose \"What are the risks?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any [[guard]]s at these holy sites?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Probably not, though I suppose you risk offending the gods and earning their enmity for all time. If you take stock in that sort of thing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good enough for now. I'll keep an eye out for the bracelet you want.''\nSometime later, Kassandra returned with the bracelet.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Ah, my lovely [[Mercenary|misthios]]. What news?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I expect to be paid for my time.=\nKassandra gives it to her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The time I sink into finding these trinkets for you had better be amply rewarded.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Does my little [[hoplite]] feel undervalued?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't see you risking your life over wild waters.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Ha! In my youth I sailed every sea and explored every island as if driven by [[Poseidon]]. But now I carry a burden like [[Atlas]]. Don't worry, Kassandra. I have a fat purse for your efforts.''\n|-|I found it for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''An amazing piece. You will look magnificent with it, like Aphrodite herself.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''I am no soft and simple plaything.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, of course not.

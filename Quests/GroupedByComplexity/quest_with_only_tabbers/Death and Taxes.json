How much will it cost to get me the records?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''That's not going to work this time, Agapios. The [[Soldier|guards]] are under strict orders not to let anyone in or out of the warehouse. It's an order they will enforce, my friend. Take my advice. Stay away from that warehouse.''\nThe man left.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's lucky your \"friend\" warned you.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Ha. He's just as corrupt as the rest of Euboea. I fear there's nobody honest left.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You can trust me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not all [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] are cutthroats. I can be trusted.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''That remains to be seen.''\n|-|You can't trust anyone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This world is a haven for liars. Trust no one.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''But I do trust\u2014I trust in what Euboea was, and what she can be again.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's causing the corruption?''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''A group called [[The Dagger]] are strangling Euboea with their greed. They work from the shadows, controlling the nation with bribery and blackmail. They're the reason I need the taxation records from that warehouse. I'm following a parchment trail which I believe will lead me to the person behind it all. But I'm too old to be breaking into guarded warehouses. Perhaps the shine on my [[drachma]]e can convince you to do it for me?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 I'll do it for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get the records for you.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Perhaps there is someone left in Euboea who can be trusted.''\n|-|You're on your own.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Taxation records don't concern me. You're on your own.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''I can't do this alone. See me again if you decide you ''do'' want to earn some drachme.''\nKassandra left the docks, only to change her mind and return later.\n*'''Agapios:''' ''You've returned! I can't find the identity of the person leading the Dagger without those records. Please, you must help me find them!''\n(Return to first dialogue option.)\n</tabber>\n(If \"Where can I find the records?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find the records you're looking for?''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''I'll need a lot of evidence to find the person behind The Dagger\u2014one set of records won't be enough. They'll be scattered around the warehouse... And be sure to check the guard captain\u2014anything important, he'll have on him.''\n(If \"Who is the leader of The Dagger?\" is chosen.)\n[[File:ACOD-DeathAndTaxes-09.jpg|thumb|250px|Agapios talking to Kassandra]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What can you tell me about the man behind The Dagger?''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Other than he may not be a man? Only his reputation is known\u2014cruel, driven by greed... A living noose around the neck of Euboea. If we can't find out who he is and stop him, our fate is that of [[Eretria]]'s: total ruin.''\n(If \"Why are they called The Dagger??\" is chosen)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Dagger\u2014dramatic name. Any particular reason?''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''They stab at Euboea without honor\u2014from the shadows, unseen, bleeding our nation of its lifeblood. A dramatic name, perhaps\u2014but apt.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I have enough information.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find the records. The guards won't stand a chance.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''They don't ''deserve'' a chance. For Euboea to survive, corruption and those who spread it ''must'' be crushed. I'll wait for you here.''\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to Agapios once more.\n*'''Agapios:''' ''You're back\u2014but where are the records? Without them, I'll never uncover the leader of The Dagger!''\nKassandra left. Surveying Chalkis with the help of Ikaros, she found a guarded quarter of the city.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The warehouse grounds.''\n[[File:ACOD-DeathAndTaxes-04.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra infiltrating the warehouse grounds]]\nIkaros continued surveying and identified the warehouse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The warehouse.''\nCircling some more, Ikaros spotted the docks.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The warehouse dock.''\nKassandra infiltrated the warehouse grounds.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now to find those records.''\nOn a table near the docks, she found a tax record.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Records of the trades Euboea's made in the last 6 months. Maybe the identity of The Dagger's leader is in here?''\nKassandra left the docks and headed inside the warehouse, where she recovered a ship manifest on a shelf.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe this will help Agapios identify The Dagger's leader.''\nKassandra sneaked up on the guard captain, killing him. On his body, she recovered a customer record.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Records of ship names\u2014what docked where and when. This might help Agapios.''\n[[File:ACOD-DeathAndTaxes-07.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra returning to Agapios]]\nHaving found what she needed, Kassandra departed the warehouse and returned to Agapios near the market.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've found the records, Agapios.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''My master will be pleased.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a [[slavery|slave]]?!''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Do I not look as you expect? Yes,'' misthios'', I am a slave\u2014but I am not without dignity. The local [[Magistrate of Chalkis|magistrate]] is my master, and I'm his most trusted servant.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I would never be someone's property.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I would rather die than be a slave.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Not all have the luxury of choice, friend.''\n|-|You're a survivor.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We do what we have to to survive.''\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Exactly. I don't blame my father for selling me into slavery, it's what he had to do. It got me out of my old life, and gave me a chance at a better one.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Agapios:''' ''Nobody chooses to be a slave. But being one provides me food, shelter, safety, and security. Especially now, with Euboea all but run by The Dagger. They cannot see past their greed., and if they go unchecked we may all end up as slaves.''\n[[File:ACOD-DeathAndTaxes-08.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra considers Agapios' words]]\nKassandra pondered on Agapios' words.\n*'''Agapios:''' ''If uncovering the identity of The Dagger's leader and finally stopping them sounds like something you'd be interested in, meet me and my master in the [[Slave Market]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll think about it.''\nAgapios departed.",

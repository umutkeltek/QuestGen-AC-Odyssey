But I have no idea what they meant.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've never seen them before?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Come to think of it... They did look familiar.

''Pater's'' house.''\n\nKassandra brought him inside.\n\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''So... does my enchanting rescuer have a name?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Well met. I'm Lykinos, famed poet of Athens. I have come to visit my dear ''pater'' and brother. Speaking of which... Timotheos! I'm home! This is the lovely Kassandra. She rescued me on my way here. Where's...''\n\nHis brother walked in, looking somber.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Father's dead.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''What?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''He was killed a few days ago. By local bandits.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''And this is how you tell me?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I need to prepare for the burial. I suggest you do the same.''\n\nHe handed Kassandra a reward.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''For saving my brother.

How should I track down the bandits Timotheos mentioned?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Their hideout is rumored to be just west of here in the [[Ruined Temple of Zeus]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll make sure the bandits pay for what they did.''\n\nShe walked away, and saw Timotheos leaning against a pillar.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos... You said you could use my help?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''My father served in the Athenian military. He deserves a proper burial in his Athenian armor. But that armor was stolen from our home not that long ago.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to get it back?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''No, my father said he saw the thief running out of town after he stole it. But the merchant should have some Athenian armor. Tell him it's for [[Diokles (Fisherman)|Diokles]] burial. They were friends.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get the armor for your father's burial.''\n\nShe walked away, with tasks from both brothers.",

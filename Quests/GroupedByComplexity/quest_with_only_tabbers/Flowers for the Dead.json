But first, there's something I need to do. Will you help an old man fulfil his dying wish?<br>I can offer you what [[drachma]]e I have left.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't deny an old man his final wish. What is it?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I always promised my wife I'd take her to see the red flowers on the [[Summit of Mount Ida|summit]] of the [[Mount Ida|mountain]] in [[Zeus' Playground]].

I did.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So what do you want me to do?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I need you to pick some of those red flowers for me from the Summit of Mount Ida so I can take them to my wife when I meet [[Hades]].<br>Just a few would do. Bring them back to me here. I'll be waiting, ''misthios''. And\u2014<br>I don't have long.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I understand.''\nKassandra headed to Mount Ida and reached the summit.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the place the old man spoke of.''\nShe found the flowers among the bushes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There it is. The flower.''\nShe picked up the flowers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The flowers... I should hurry back to the old man near [[Gortyn]].''\nKassandra quickly returned to where the old man was at.

If a reward is insisted on, the daughter gives the old man's [[Veteran Breastplate|armor]] and some drachmae.",

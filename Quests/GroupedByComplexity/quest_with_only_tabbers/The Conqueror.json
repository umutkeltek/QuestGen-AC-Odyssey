We've worked together once\u2014we can do it again.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Your help in Megaris might have secured the region for Sparta, but I lost more than I gained.

The Boeotian rebels are a problem, but nothing we can't handle.''\n(If players asked \"Why are you here?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is the Spartan army doing in Boeotia?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''We sieged Athens, but [[Kleon]] took power and pushed us out.

Nesaia was last seen in the forest east of Thebes.''\n(If players asked \"Why are they helping Athens?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought the Boeotians hated everyone. Why are they working with Athens?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''They see both Sparta and Athens as enemies\u2014but Athens got here first, and they agreed to a temporary alliance.''\n(If players asked \"What makes them so mighty?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's so great about these champions? They're just four people against the Spartan military.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Sparta has its army, and Boeotia has its legends. They're a symbol of what this place used to be.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I have what I need.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The sooner I get this done, the sooner we take Boeotia for Sparta.''\nStentor walked off without another word. Kassandra made her way around Boeotia hunting and killing the champions. When the fourth had fallen, she reunited with Stentor at the Spartans' forward camp in the [[Scorched Rolling Plains]].\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You're back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The champions have been dealt with.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You should be dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You seem disappointed.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''The gods are punishing me.''\n<tabber>\n|-|No, the gods are helping you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're not punishing you - they're helping you. Why do you think I'm here?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''The gods must hate me if our paths keep crossing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From what I've seen, you needed a divine intervention.''\n|-|There's nothing godly about this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a mercenary - killing is what I do. There's nothing godly about it.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Modest, but mortal... and [[Hades]] will have you, too.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll cross that [[Styx|river]] when we get to it.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I don't have time for this. Sparta must take the region now, while we have the chance.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"Let's go to war.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's get this over with.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I couldn't agree more. The sooner I'm rid of you, the better.''\nKassandra brushed off his venom and turned out of the tent to ready for battle.\n[[File:ACOD Battle of Boeotia.png|thumb|250px|The Battle of Boeotia]]\nWith the sun high in the sky, the Conquest Battle for Boeotia began. Kassandra made her way around the [[Battleground of Boeotia|battleground]] slaying captains and hired mercenary help. Before the day was over, the Athenian ranks had broken, and Sparta had claimed control of the region. Stentor basked in his victory.\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Victory is ours!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Thanks to you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The victory is yours. You led us well today.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''My father taught me everything I know about commanding an army. Too bad you took him from me - or I might have learned more.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stop...''\n|-|You're lucky I was here.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I hadn't been here, you'd never have survived.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''My father would have ensured a more decisive victory, but he's not here. We have you to thank for that, if I recall.''\nKassandra rolled her eyes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't start...''\n</tabber>\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Don't you dare tell me what to do. I am in command here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You needed my help.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''By the gods, how are you so arrogant? No wonder my father discarded you.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Nikolaos alive=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know nothing about my family.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I know he threw you off a [[Mount Taygetos|cliff]] and chose me instead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now who's being arrogant? You were an afterthought\u2014you were second place.''\n|-|Nikolaos dead=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And yet I'm here, and he isn't.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You fucking murderer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Believe me, he had it coming.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You will pay for what you've done.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've already paid more than enough for one lifetime.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Stentor:''' ''We'll see about that.''\nStentor repositioned himself.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Now that we've driven the Athenians from the field, it's time I dealt with my true enemy.''\n[[File:ACOD The Conqueror 13.png|thumb|250px|Stentor challenging Kassandra]]\nHe drew his spear.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stentor you...''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Your job is done, mercenary. Now I will kill you for what you stole from me in Megaris.''\n(If players asked \"Why do you want to fight?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why are you doing this?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Because\u2014Because you marched into Megaris. Ruined the fucking war. And murdered\u2014my\u2014father.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did what I had to.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''And so will I.''\n(If players asked \"What do you gain from this?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What could you possibly gain from killing me?''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Justice, vengeance, peace. One would be enough, but all three is better.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You think vengeance will dull your pain? Trust me, it won't.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Here's the thing. I don't trust you.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Neither of us has to die.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't have to do this, Stentor.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Oh, but I do. There is nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This isn't what Nikolaos would've wanted.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''How would you fucking know? Traitor.''\nKassandra drew her [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am not a traitor.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You betrayed Sparta. You betrayed your family\u2014<br>You killed my father and stole my chance at a normal life. You deserve nothing but the cold of my blade buried in your heart.''\n[[File:ACOD The Conqueror 15.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Stentor at a stand-still]]\nNothing Kassandra said could sway her adoptive brother. They circled each other as Stentor's men looked on, ready to duel to the death.\n\n===Nikolaos returned===\nBefore they could take their first lunges with their spears, Nikolaos walked forward and parted the soldiers, chastising his children.\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Killing each other won't heal the wounds of the past.''\n*'''Stentor:''' Pater!\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Hello, Stentor.''\n[[File:ACOD The Conqueror 17.png|thumb|250px|Nikolaos interrupting Kassandra and Stentor]]\nThe crowd of Spartan soldiers dispersed and left Nikolaos to speak with his children.\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I thought you were dead.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Not just yet.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''She should pay for what she's done!''\n<tabber>\n|-|I did nothing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How many times do I have to tell you\u2014''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Stentor, she owes me nothing.''\n|-|I've paid plenty.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've already paid more than you could ever know.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I don't give a shit what you've been through.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Stentor, it's done.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I don't understand.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''You both have a greater role to play.

You will be a better commander than I ever was. You can do this.''\nStentor grasped his father's arms.\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I will, father. I will make you proud.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''You already have.''\nStentor glanced at Kassandra, and she nodded at him.

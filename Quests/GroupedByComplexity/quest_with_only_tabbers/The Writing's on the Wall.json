And I think that someone could be you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where they are and I'll put an end to this.''\n[[File:ACOD The Writing's on the Wall - Kassandra Agellos Graffiti.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Agellos discuss the graffiti]]\nThe man pointed to the graffiti.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''See the pigment of the paint, it's a rare color and I only know one artist who chooses to use it.

That'll add more fuel to the fire.''\nKassandra sighed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If that's what you want.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''It is what she wants. Phoenix wants to fight for the people\u2014not against them. Just stop them making anymore art.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you consider this \"art\".''\nThe merchant returned to his stall and Kassandra begun to investigate the paintings around the ''agora''. She looked at the ground beneath the first one.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This came from whatever wrote this message. I'll take it to the art merchant.''\nShe passed by the merchant and went to the ''{{Wiki|colonnade}}'' behind his stall. Inside, a crowd was studying the graffiti vandalized over the mural. She walked through them and examined it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's some hair stuck in the paint. Maybe from the brush the artist used? I'd better ask Agellos.''\nShe then went out opposite it and across the agora to find one more attracting a crowd. Kassandra approaches it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This color looks strange.

Do you recognize them?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''That, my friend, is {{Wiki|Emery (rock)|Emery}}. Used for various artistic endeavors. Won't give the pottery as good of a shine in that state though.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Emery? The rock? Is it found on Naxos?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''It's mined from the Routsouna waterfall.''\n(If players choose \"Who has bought this pigment?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This pigment is only used in the graffiti. Has anyone been buying this from you?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Hmmm, I do remember a man asking about this color now that you mention it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just him?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Yes from what I remember. I didn't have any when he asked. He seemed impatient and asked if anyone else sold it.''\n(If players choose \"What is this hair from?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found this hair stuck in the paint of the graffiti. Does it mean anything to you?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Many artists here on Naxos use wild animal hairs to form the bristles on their paint brushes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What animal is this hair from?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''It's too long to be a [[deer]]. I've heard that some thrill-seekers like to get hairs from the [[bear]]s that live on the island. They're mad if you ask me, but artists are an unusual sort.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I have to go.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you.'' Errosso.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Maybe you'll buy something next time.''\n[[File:ACOD The Writing's on the Wall - Kassandra Finding Lichas.png|thumb|250px|Lichas confronted by Kassandra]]\nKassandra found and entered the cave at Routsouna Waterfall and discovered a crack in the wall leading to a secret chamber. \n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's that artist, found you.''\n\nAt the bottom, she found the propagandist, [[Lichas]], practicing his drawings.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There you are.

Phoenix is a ''great'' leader\u2014tell her I said that! I'm just the hand, not the mind.''\n\n(If players choose \"Why write messages you don't believe?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you're a gutless sheep. You write what you don't believe.''\n*'''Lichas:''' ''I didn't know it would go this far.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me why you did it.''\n*'''Lichas:''' ''I was commissioned! A contract from soldiers. They have power! ''You'' try defying people like that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I would. I'm not spineless.''\n*'''Lichas:''' Misthios'', I'm a poor artist! The Archon promised [[drachma]]e I've never dreamed of!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And look where it got you.''\n*'''Lichas:''' ''I'll stop now, I promise!

Some archon paid him to do it.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''The young are so impressionable these days. They're always looking for ways to make a name for themselves like the {{Wiki|Greek Heroic Age|heroes of old}}. I'm glad it's over.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So that's one obstacle down.

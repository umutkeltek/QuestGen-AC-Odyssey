But ignoring this danger is foolishness. These...''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I know who they are.''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''Then you know the danger you're in.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I would like to know what makes you so certain they're coming.''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''Did you not hear what I said? These are their most skilled killers. You cannot stay in the public eye. They'll find you.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I understand you perfectly. But I also need to be ''seen.'' The [[Lichas|propagandist]] did his job well. I need more support to attack [[Paros Island|Paros]].''\nWhile talking, Myrrine smiled and waved at the people.\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''I've seen too many people die already. Please, come away from here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Aspasia? What brings you here?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Kassandra! Read the room, my dear...''\nMyrrine winked at her daughter.\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll play along.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm interrupting. Please, continue your discussion. It sounds ''fascinating.\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''I've just come to tell your mother that the Cult's elite forces are after her, and that this place is too open.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''And I've been telling Aspasia I need to appear in public to maintain the support of the citizens.''\n|-|You're reacting strangely.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's this about the Cult sending soldiers?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Play along. The people here need convincing that I'm still a worthy leader. Aspasia is trying to have me hide myself away.''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''She is under threat of assassination. My sources say the elite forces are already in [[Naxos Island|Naxos]]. I cannot watch this happen [[Athens's Last Hope|again]].''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to handle the Cult's soldiers?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Not only that. My people won't believe Paros is behind this without proof. I need you to find it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Good. And I'll make the rounds here, shore up my support.<br>Be careful. They're dangerous.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know.''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''I'll get her out of here safely.''\n(If players asked \"Where do I find these killers?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where do your ''sources'' say I should start looking?''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''I'd try the [[Cave of Mt. Zas|caves]] under [[Mt. Zas]]. The Cultists are so enamored with their own mysticism. It's predictable enough for them.''\n(If players asked \"What 'proof' do you think I'll find?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't think anyone sent to kill you is going to admit who they're working for.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''You're right. Physical proof is better. I'm sure you can find it.''\n(Leave - \"I'll go now.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course. I'd be happy to help you both. I'll see you again later.''\nKassandra left the two and rode south for the [[Zeus' Overwatch|peak]] of Mt. Zas. With the help of [[Ikaros]], she found the entrance.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A cave entrance. They're in there.''\nKassandra navigated the cave, unhindered by the [[Athens|Athenian]] soldiers within, and made her way to a crack in the wall at the back. She slipped through to a secret shrine with [[Isu|curious]] architecture, where two Cult soldiers were praying to a statue of the god [[Zeus]]. She killed the soldiers and inspected their remains.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Drachma]]e. All stamped with the seal of Paros. And a letter? In some kind of code.''\n[[File:ACOD_Death_and_Disorder_-_Kassandra_Returns.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra returning from her mission]]\nKassandra made her way out of the cave and back to Myrrine's [[Naxos villa|villa]] to report to the women. She tossed the pouch onto the table.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Cult's soldiers were paid with drachmae from Paros.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Well. I could hardly ask for clearer proof. This will settle some scores.''\nMyrrine addressed Timo, tossing the bag of coins to her.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Take these to the [[merchant]]s' guild. Tell them it's the proof I promised. And tell them... they can keep the coins.''\n*'''Timo:''' ''Of course.''\n[[File:ACOD_Death_and_Disorder_-Cultist_Scroll.png|thumb|250px|Cultist scroll placed on the table]]\nTimo took the pouch. Kassandra rolled the letter across the table.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There was also this. I assume it's their orders.''\nAspasia opened the letter and pored it over for a while.\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''I recognize this. It's an old dialect. The Cult must use it to communicate with one another.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can read it?''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''This money isn't from [[Silanos]]. It's from [[Pausanias of Sparta|someone]] in [[Sparta]].''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''That's not possible.''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''I can translate it for you. But these orders come from a [[Two Kings of Sparta|Spartan king]].''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''The Spartan nobility has always resisted the Cult!''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''The Cult is like water. Any crack in the stone and they'll get in.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Sparta stands against corruption!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Sparta has always been corrupt.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How can you say that after all Sparta has done to you? They tore apart our family! They ''welcomed'' the Cult with open arms.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Why do you keep saying \"they\"?''\n|-|Sparta has changed.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sparta has changed since we were there. Corruption spreads everywhere, as Aspasia says - even to Sparta. They want to instill discipline across the [[Greece|Greek]] world while they rot from within. They're focused on the wrong enemy.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD_Death_and_Disorder_-_Myrrine_Making_Her_Decision.png|thumb|250px|Myrrine deciding to return to Sparta]]\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I am still Spartan.''\nShe raised her gaze to Kassandra.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''And so are you.''\n*'''Aspasia:''' ''Are you really?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I have responsibilities here. Paros needs to be stopped.<br>But then? Yes, I will go back.''",

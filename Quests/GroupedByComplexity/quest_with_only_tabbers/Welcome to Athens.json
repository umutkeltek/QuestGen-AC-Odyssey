Meeting with Herodotos at the Pnyx, she witnessed [[Perikles]] talking to a crowd.\n*'''Perikles:''' ''The [[Sparta]]ns may draw near to our walls, but we must come together now for the glory of Athens.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Glory for you!''\nA civilian threw food at Perikles, hitting him.\n*'''[[Kleon]]:''' ''Friends! Friends, please! Just because the Spartans are near our walls does not mean we can act like them.''\nHe picked the food off of Perikles, eating it.\n*'''Kleon:''' ''A good crop! Shame the Spartans burned the fields where it grew. The [[Parthenon]] is glorious, Perikles, but at what cost? How many triremes could we have built instead?''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''We must not become divided\u2014''\n*'''Kleon:''' ''We are ''divided'', and the Spartans are winning! Act, Perikles, or I will!''\nHerodotos came upon Kassandra as she listened.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Oh good, you came. Things are worse than I feared. Kleon has turned the mob. We have to hurry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''To Perikles.''\nThey approached Perikles, only to be blocked by an Athenian soldier.\n*'''Athenian Soldier:''' ''Stay back.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''She's no threat to Perikles, I assure you.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''Ah, Herodotos. It's fine. Let them through.''\n[[File:ACOD Welcome to Athens Memory Screenshot 01.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Herodotos greeted by Perikles]]\nPerikles shook the hands of Herodotos.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It's good to see you again, Perikles.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''And you as well. I only wish it were under better circumstances. And who's this?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''Welcome, Kassandra. And what did you think of your first taste of Athens?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You both made good points.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think you and Kleon both made good points.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''Good points aren't at all what the crowd seemed to care about. They're afraid, and Kleon indulged their fear.''\n|-|...=\nKassandra stayed quiet.\n*'''Perikles:''' ''Nothing to say? Others would do well to realize silence is as much as an answer as anything else. A crowd would seize the first easy answer that comes its way, like a hungry dog on a bone.''\n|-|You did great.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think you did a great job.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''It's so easy to forget the good someone has done when times become hard.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Perikles, we've come to\u2014''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''We must choose our moment wisely and speak our words more privately.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine. We've come to you on... urgent business.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''As does everybody.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I may have told Kassandra you'd invite her to your symposium.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''You'd ask me to exclude every Athenian and invite an outsider instead? You heard the crowd. They don't need another reason to hate me.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''If she's working for you, maybe the prying eyes will see her as a servant.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm no one's \"servant.\"''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Kassandra, this is Athens. If you want something, sometimes you have to play the role.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''And what exactly is it that you want?''\n<tabber>\n|-|We all want something.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We're all after something, even you.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''You're better at reading others than you let on.''\n|-|I'm looking for someone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for a woman who's very important to me. Herodotos said a symposium could be useful for gaining information.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''He would be correct. I can get you in, although I can't promise the information you seek will be found.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just tell me what to do.''\n[[File:ACOD Welcome to Athens Memory Screenshot 03.png|thumb|250px|Perikles tasking Kassandra to help his associates]]\n*'''Perikles:''' ''First, check on my colleague, [[Metiochos]]. He was meant to meet me today, and it's not like him to miss an appointment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Done.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''My friend, [[Phidias]], needs to be taken out of Athens as soon as possible.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anything else?''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''Yes, there's an ostracism vote taking place that could use your... influence.''\n(If players choose \"Who is Metiochos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Metiochos... you said he was your colleague?''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''A politician and ally. He's one of my most loyal friends.''\n(If players choose \"What did Phidias do?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phidias... the famous sculptor? What did he do, exactly?''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''He stands accused of multiple offenses and is awaiting trial. You'll find him under close guard at his workshop.''\n(If players choose \"What's an ostracism?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ostracism?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Exile is a term you may be more familiar with. Here in Athens, we vote between two people to decide who should leave.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''It's between the sophist, [[Anaxagoras]], and another man. On trial for impiety. My contact near the agora will give you the details.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do it.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''I'll expect you to use discretion.''\nPerikles took his leave.\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''That went well! It isn't exactly an invitation, but the promise is just as good. Although I'm sure he'll still ask [[Aspasia]] if it's OK.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So long as it comes.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "On Herotodos' suggestion, Kassandra met the Athenian statesman Perikles at the Pnyx. There, Perikles requested Kassandra to help him with a number of errands in exchange for the information that she needs.",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to the [[Porneion]] in [[Korinthia]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Korinth, the city of pots, prostitutes, and not much else.<br />Alkibiades said the ''hetaerae'' here could help me find my mother.<br />I should look around for Anthousa's whereabouts.''\nShe addressed a civilian in the area.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for Anthousa. Is she here?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Wouldn't ''I'' like to know. Sunrise, sunset, I save my [[drachma]]e for a taste of the divine. The ''hetaerae'' are hard to come by!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you haven't seen them.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Not with [[the Monger]]'s army on the loose. The ''hetaerae'' won't tolerate that.''\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 01.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra speaking to one of the civilians]]\nBefore Kassandra left him, he spoke once more.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''You let me know if you find those girls! They have to be ''somewhere'' in this city.''\nKassandra accosted another civilian.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Haven't done something wrong, have I? Swear I haven't!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you have, you might see me later. I'm looking for Anthousa.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Phew.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know her?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''No one ''really'' knows Anthousa. And the ''hetaerae'' got pushed out of here ages ago!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Why aren't they in the Porneion?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Pushed out?\" So someone didn't want them here.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''We don't like to say his name\u2014in case his men overhear. Just know the ''hetaerae'' were forced to move out of Korinth's markets.''\n|-|I need to find them.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can you tell me where they've gone?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I haven't seen 'em since, I swear it! I can't afford to pay 'em.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hm. Then I'll keep looking.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Someone around here's gotta know. 'Til then, I'll be on my best behavior, ''misthios!<br />''Just minding my own business, ''misthios''! I'm sure someone here can help you.''\nIn the corner, Kassandra spotted a woman and approached her.\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 02.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra with another civilian]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you Anthousa?''\n*'''Civilian:''' Me?'' Anthousa? I could be anyone for you, lamb. I charge less than the hetaerae, but do I ever know my way around a hay-bed!''\nThe woman stepped closer to Kassandra, flirting with her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So her name means something to you.''\nThe woman stepped back.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Anthousa? She's been around forever, but I never met her. I know the ''hetaerae'' all work as one\u2014on equal footing\u2014but Anthousa's special. She talks\u2014they listen.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Who are the hetaerae?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I haven't met any ''hetaerae'' yet.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Don't believe all you hear. They sell what a lot of us sell in Korinth\u2014but for them, it's not just about the flesh. They're [[merchant]]s of a sort. Streetwise\u2014can talk as nice as they look.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like a good trade to work in. You don't want to be a hetaerae?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Not in my prime anymore, am I, ''misthios''? By the time I study what they did, I'll be serving clients on my deathbed!''\n|-|Help me find the hetaerae.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the ''hetaerae'' aren't here, where are they?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Their sort are too high-and-mighty to be down here in the dirt with us. You want 'em, you'll find 'em up on the hill\u2014the [[Akrokorinth]]. By the [[Temple of Aphrodite, Korinth|Temple]], keeping [[Aphrodite]]'s worshippers satisfied.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Civilian:''' ''No pay, no play! If you want your precious ''hetaerae'', go to the Temple of Aphrodite.''\nWith information in hand, Kassandra traveled to the Akrokorinth. When she reached the temple, she overheard thugs threatening some worshippers.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Please, leave us!''\n*'''Monger Thug:''' ''The ''hetaerae''! Where are they?!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''The ''hetaerae'' aren't here!''\n*'''Monger Thug:''' ''Then ''you're'' gonna pay for the trouble we went through to find 'em.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who do they think they are? I need to stop them.''\nKassandra killed the thugs, with the civilians helping by crying out warnings when more approached. Once victorious, she set about questioning the worshippers.\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 03.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra speaking to the civilians harrassed by the Monger's men]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who were they? And why were they looking for the hetaerae?''\n*'''Civilian:''' '' ''Ai-ya!'' They think this temple is dedicated to ''them'', the brutes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Thief|thieves]] are here and the ''hetaerae'' aren't.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''The hetaerae? They're much wiser than we are. They realized their visitors were all getting robbed on the way in.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''There's no avoiding the Monger's men in Korinth.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Then I should look out for him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll keep my guard up.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''He craves money, ''misthios''.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Not only that, but ''power.'' Once he smells it on you, you're a goner!''\n|-|The Monger? That's a stupid name.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who walks around with a name like the \"Monger\"?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Don't let him hear you say that.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Last time his name came out of a fool's mouth, the man's tongue was sliced out.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So the Monger is a Korinthian criminal?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Master of the underground markets. He rules with one hand open for money, and the other clenched around a weapon.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''A drachmae\u2014and blood-hungry monster's what he is!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|What does the Monger want from the hetaerae?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So he's hunting for the ''hetaerae''. For money?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Exactly. Since the ''hetaerae'' bring in so much drachmae, he wants everything they control!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''The thieves are better off robbin' ''them'' than us.''\n|-|I'm looking for Anthousa.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you know of the ''hetaerae'', then you know of Anthousa. I'm looking for her.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''They say she's everywhere, though I've never seen her. But the ''hetaerae'' see ''everything!\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I've seen them gather by the [[Spring of Peirene]], down the mountain. They meet clients there, and then take 'em elsewhere in secret.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. Maybe pray to Aphrodite from home next time.''\nKassandra made her way to the Spring in hopes of finding Anthousa. As she approached, she overheard voices of women discussing urgently.\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 04.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra's first meeting with Anthousa]]\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''It shouldn't be long now. No, it ''won't'' be, I'm sure of it.''\n*'''Hetaera:''' ''Then they'll help?''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Everyone has something they want. My job is to figure out how much they'll give for that something.''\n*'''Hetaera:''' ''Then Korinth will be ours again.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Very soon, it will return to its rightful hands.''\nAs Kassandra approached the women, they noticed her and Anthousa opened her arms to welcome her.\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Ah, so Kassandra has finally found us.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know me?''\n*'''Hetaera:''' ''And you know her. This is Anthousa.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''We saw you help the worshippers at the temple of Aphrodite. You've proven yourself a friend.''\nKassandra glanced at [[Ikaros]], perched on a statue.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hear that, Ikaros? Her sight's as good as yours.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Someone also spoke very highly of you.''\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 05.png|thumb|250px|Phoibe arriving from behind Kassandra]]\n*'''[[Phoibe]]:''' ''Surprise!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phoibe?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''[[Aspasia]] sent me! I work for her now, remember?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But why ''here''? Korinth isn't safe.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I had to tell Anthousa you were coming! Aspasia taught me a new word: \"emissary.\" That's me!''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''And now Kassandra and I have met.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''See? This is easy! And now I can help you!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You shouldn't be here.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's a killer on the loose in a city with no morals to begin with. You can't just follow me around like in [[Kephallonia]].''\nPhoibe pouted, and crossed her arms.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''The Monger, the [[Cyclops of Kephallonia|Cyclops]]... I made it all the way here, didn't I?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, you always find a way.''\n|-|Now's not the time.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You and I will talk about this later.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I don't work for you\u2014I work for Aspasia!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then the work she gave you should keep you busy.''\n|-|That would be great.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I guess that would be all right. Who knows what I'll get into?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Yes!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just make sure you're extra careful.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''We need to move inside, Kassandra. We're not the only ones watching. Come with me, and we'll talk.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Can I come?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''As long as you're quiet.''\nThey walked into the chamber of the Spring.\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 06.png|thumb|250px|Anthousa bringing Kassandra and Phoibe to a shelter]]\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''To what do I owe your visit?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Alkibiades told me about you.''\nAnthousa laughed.\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Did he? Go on.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for a woman from [[Sparta]]\u2014a runaway, long ago. She may have gone by the name of [[Myrrine]].''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Who's that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's my mother.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Your mother? You don't ''have'' a mother! [[Markos]] told me ''he'' raised you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did I tell you about talking?''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''I see. There will be time to respond to your question, but that time isn't now.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That's not an answer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not the answer I'm looking for.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''It's the only one you'll get until I've bargained a proper exchange. I've become quite the businesswoman, after all.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You better be telling the truth! Kassandra can get ''really'' mad.''\n|-|So you've heard of her.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''As long as you tell me what you know sooner or later.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''You'll have to trust me. You don't get to where I stand without credibility. My word is yours.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''And you can always trust Kassandra!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why don't you go play, Phoibe? Let me and Anthousa talk.''\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 07.png|thumb|250px|Phoibe being told to leave the conversation]]\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''If you say so.''\nPhoibe left the two to talk.\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''I propose a trade. Help me\u2014help ''us''\u2014get stronger. Strong enough to rid Korinth of the Monger permanently. A simple transaction, I assure you.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It's a deal.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have a deal.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''A wise decision, dear ''misthios''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I haven't made it this far being a fool. I know when to take a chance.''\n|-|You better repay me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''As long as you deliver what I'm looking for, we won't have a problem.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Negotiation always involves some compromise, you know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Compromise I can do. But I won't be cheated.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Then we're in business. Now. You've heard of the Monger?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I hear he's dangerous.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From what the worshippers say, he's someone I should watch out for.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''They're right. I'm sure his victims wish they'd been more vigilant. ''My'' eyes are wide open.''\n|-|I'm not worried about him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I heard about him after I killed his men. Seems he's famous in Korinth.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''For all the wrong reasons. His knife has shed much Korinthian blood\u2014but that's just the way of commerce. The blood between us is bad.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you've held your ground well. You're not dead.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Not yet, anyway. But he's employed enough thugs to amass a small army. Now they're attacking people in the street\u2014us included.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's been killing hetaerae?''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Killing? We're smarter than that. But action must be taken before it goes that far.''\nAnthousa stepped past Kassandra, gesturing at the world outside.\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''I'm not the only one who needs help. My girls, [[Damalis]] and [[Erinna]], are suffering too.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''More Monger trouble?''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''I wouldn't doubt it. Work against their aggressors, and then it will be his turn to suffer. You'll find Damalis here at the spring, but Erinna has gone to [[Bellerophron's Garden]].''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll talk to them.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what I can do for them.''\n|-|What is Erinna's problem?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's wrong with Erinna?''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''She's looking for [[Kleio]]\u2014another ''hetaera''\u2014who's gone missing. I've been too distracted to help in the search.''\n|-|What is Damalis's problem?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Has Damalis told you what's wrong?''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''She hasn't told me much, but I know these girls as well as I know myself. Something's not right.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Good. The Monger feeds his thugs with the drachmae he makes smuggling\u2014weapons mostly, which is all the more lucrative now that he has a war to supply.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So if someone interrupts the Monger's supply, his men go hungry.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Exactly. Go to his [[The Monger's Warehouse|warehouse]] in the [[Port of Lechaion]] and burn his cargo. All of it. We'll let chaos take care of the rest.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Why does the Monger bother stealing?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why rob people who can't put two ''drachmae'' together if he has a business? It's illegitimate, but gets him rich.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''Even the smuggling is a front. He steals [[Slavery|slaves]]\u2014innocents, who shouldn't be harmed. But his thugs can burn.''\n[[File:ACOD To Find a Girl 08.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra accepting Anthousa's proposal]]\n|-|Why burn the warehouse?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Seems to me that burning his biggest source of income is asking for trouble.''\n*'''Anthousa:''' ''I want to put new muscle I've acquired on show. Plus, violence is the only language he understands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know many people who speak that language.''\n|-|I'll do it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then the warehouse will be cinders.''\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "On Alkibiades' advise, Kassandra met the hetaerae Anthousa, agreeing to help her deal with the Monger in exchange for information on her mother's whereabouts.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "Two of the three thugs threatening the heterae have unique avatars when viewed by Ikaros. They can be recruited as lieutenants for the Adrestia. The other thug when viewed appears as a regular male civilian, but also carries the [[Thug's Bracers]], a somewhat unique item. The three at the back of the temple have regular avatars.",

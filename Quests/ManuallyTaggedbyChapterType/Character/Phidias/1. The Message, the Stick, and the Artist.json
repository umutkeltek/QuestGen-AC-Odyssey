    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra found Phidias in his [[Phidias' Workshop, Olympia|workshop]] and greeted him.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Ah, you are a welcome sight. Your beauty brings light into the darkness of what has become my life.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's good to see you too, Phidias.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Now this is important. No one saw you come here did they?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No... Why?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''You're sure you weren't followed. Good, good. They're out there, though. Watching, waiting...''\n(If \"Who's out there?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who's after you?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''The [[Cult of Kosmos]]. Remember [[Athens]]? They never stopped hunting me, Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would they be after you now?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''They want me dead. Moving me here has only bought a little more time. I need your help.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What makes you think you're in trouble now?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''The other day I received a scytale, and a note.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone left you a piece of wood and a letter... I can see why you're frightened.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Oh, it's so much more than that.''\n(If \"What's a scytale?\" is chosen)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's so special about a stick?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''It's not just any stick! The'' {{Wiki|scytale}} ''is used by the [[Sparta]]ns to send coded messages.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK, so let's talk about your stick.''\n*'''Phidias:''' Scytale''!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right,'' scytale''.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''I need to get the code. Then I'll show you how it works.''\n(If \"What did the note say?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did the message say?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Look to your art... The king of gods has a message to impart.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fantastic, that's not a message. It's barely passable as a riddle!''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''It's obvious, the king of gods.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Jupiter|Zeus]]?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Yes, and what am I?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's so many answers to that, but I suppose you're a sculptor.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Exactly!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where do I need to go?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''The [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], of course! It's here in Olympia. The clue for the'' scytale ''should be around the statue.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll help you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK. If it'll put your mind at rest, I'll help.''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Thank you. Now hurry, and look to the statue of Zeus in his temple to find the message. Once I have the clue, I can decipher it with the'' scytale''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry, I'll be back as soon as I can.''\nKassandra left his workshop and went on her way to the Temple of Zeus.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phidias is paranoid, but maybe it's not all in his mind...''\nInside the temple she saw the statue of Zeus.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be what Phidias was looking for.''\n[[File:ACOD The Message, the Stick, and the Artist 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the symbol]]\nShe climbed on to the statue's lap and found a symbol then copied it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should get back to Phidias so he can decipher the message.''\nShe went back to his workshop and\u00a0handed the copy to Phidias. He quickly deciphered it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, what was the message? Did it give you the information you were looking for?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''In a manner of speaking... The message you gave me, I wrapped it around the rod.''\nKassandra giggled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You wrapped it around your rod?''\nPhidias eagerly answered.\n*'''Phidias:''' ''Yes, the'' scytale''! It's ingenious, the right message for the right rod. Wrap the cloth around it, and the letters should align, giving you the message.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, very interesting. But what did it say?''\n*'''Phidias:''' ''It's directions!''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped Phidias to locate the symbol mentioned in a mysterious letter given to him, discovering it to be some sort of directions to a mystery.",

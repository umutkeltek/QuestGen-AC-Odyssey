Upon arriving, she made her away to the stronghold. After eradicating every [[Cult of Kosmos]] [[soldier]], Kassandra went up to the command room, killed the general, and found a hallway with eight protuberances on the walls facing each other, each one using the banner emblems of the regions of Greece except for a trident. At the end of the room was a door. She approached one of the push switches.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe if I press here...''\nShe pressed the switches in sequence according to the decrypted message from the scytale, and the door unlocked. She went inside the room.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone went to a lot of trouble to hide this.''",

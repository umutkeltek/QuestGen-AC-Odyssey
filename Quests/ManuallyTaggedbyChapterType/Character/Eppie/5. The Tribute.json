I've given up fishing. I serve the gods now.''\n*'''''Kassandra:''' Fishing's worthy occupation. What caused such a change?''\n*'''''Tolmides:''''' ''A sudden storm, as if the gods themselves stepped on earth. The ship keeled over and sank. Right out there! The gods saved me.''\n*'''''Kassandra:''''' Did this happen after you picked up a stone relic?\n*'''''Tolmides:''''' ''Well, I might have used some temple rock as a boat anchor. Nothing of value.'' \n*'''''Kassandra:''''' It's good that the gods delivered to you to safety.\n\nShe investigated coastline, finding the [[Sunken Temple of Aphrodite]].

    "Section_Description": "After recovering the remain steles, Kassandra returned to [[Eppie]] to solve the [[Mycenae]]n mystery once and for all.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra returned to Eppie in the [[Mycenaean Tomb|tomb]] behind the [[Cave of the Oracle]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've found the final stele pieces. All of the [[armor]] has been found as well.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I can hardly contain myself. This will be life-changing, hero! [[Isu|Primordial gods]], worth, [[Eagle Vision|inner vision]]! What can it all mean?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll know soon enough, when you finish translating.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Yes! You're right. The stele needs to be assembled. Come!''\n[[File:ACOD Keep the Faith 1.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Eppie at the wall of text]]\nThey returned to the wall of text.\n*'''Eppie:''' ''This is the cusp of a great discovery. Will the gods speak to us? What will I say to them? What will they say to me? Does it matter?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Perhaps when you read it...''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Yes, yes! Hmm... Only those who possess inner vision, a gift of the primordial gods, will be deemed worth to wield power of the Great {{Wiki|List of Mycenaean deities|Dipsioi}}. Dipsioi? What do you make of that?''\nThe text of the glow started to glow, seemingly only visible to Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am amazed.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I don't understand. There's no change that I see. It's the same place as when we first arrived.''\nEppie started walking away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Look around you.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I see nothing. What do you see?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Lie \u2013 There's dust in my eyes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing's happening. It's only dust in my eyes.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Really? We are a pair, aren't we? I feel ashamed to think that I was hoping for more. Knowledge is reward enough.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's the idea.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''At least I have this discovery. But you, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]'', all you have is the armor.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's good armor. You know, Eppie? I think maybe you should continue on your journey.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Should I? Hmm. Well, there are other clues to follow.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nRecruit \u2013 We can adventure together.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I would like you to join my crew.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Really! Will it require swimming? Because you know I can't swim. And what about [[horse]]s? I don't think my backside can take it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll figure something out.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLeave \u2013 Take care, friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Take care, Eppie. I'm sure our paths will cross again.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I hope so. Especially if I'm being attacked by something.''\nKassandra walked away.\n}}\n|-|The lore is real.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The room has come to life. The gods are speaking to us.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''How can that be? Why can't I see any of this? Why should the gods not present themselves to me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I promise you, I have no idea.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Is it because I'm not worthy? Do you have inner vision? It isn't fair.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Eppie, you have the tomb. And there will be other discoveries.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Enough. Just leave me. Can you please leave?''\nKassandra walked away.\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I don't understand.''\n|-|It isn't meant for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This isn't meant for you.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Who are you to decide?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It isn't my decision. But I know that neither of us can know what the gods want with us.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I have value, too!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Calm yourself. I have no control over this. You have your discovery. That should satisfy you.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Why not me? It isn't fair.''\nKassandra walked away.\n</tabber>",

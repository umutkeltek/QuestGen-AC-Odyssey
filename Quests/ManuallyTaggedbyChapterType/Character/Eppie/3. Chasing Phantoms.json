    "General_Description": "'''Chasing Phantoms''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra travelled to the Tomb of Orion. Inside the tomb, she found a [[Aristomachos|man]] lying next to an altar, injured.\n*'''Aristomachos:''' ''Whatever you're after, you're too late. They're all gone... dead or mad.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't understand. Who did this to you?''\n*'''Aristomachos:''' ''I don't understand it myself. My brethen and I were drawn to this place, but madness took over. We fought over the artifact. One of them grabbed it and ran.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Grabbed the stele?''\n*'''Aristomachos:''' ''Search the caves. That's where they'll be hiding. Beware though, they're beyond reason.''\n[[File:ACOD Chasing Phantoms 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra arriving at the cave]]\nAs the man succumbed to his wounds, Kassandra left the tomb and headed up hill, searching for the nearby caves. She entered [[Cave of Madness|one of the caves]] and found the deceased man's brethen. After killing them, she recovered the stele and a [[Rusty Mycenaean Waistband|waistband]] from one of the bodies.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Was the stele influencing them in some way?''\nKassandra departed the cave and returned to Eppie in the Mycenaean tomb behind the [[Cave of the Oracle]]. She handed over the stele.\n[[File:ACOD Chasing Phantoms 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra returning to Eppie]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There may be some truth in this lore.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Ugh! Is that blood on it?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's otherwise undamaged. There are people claiming that it speaks to them. What could do that?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Strange. I don't hear anything. Do you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Words of madmen... Perhaps the next pieces will tell us more.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''This one needs a good cleaning... Let's hope the remaining ones are fine.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll search for the steles.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll search for the remaining steles.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''My peers will finally listen to what I have to say.<br />It says the ritual will activate something. But what? What will happen when we have all of the pieces? Will it lead to a treasure? Some of the translations is lost on me. This passage speaks of worth.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm... What else?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Um. This passage mentions something about \"[[Eagle Vision|inner vision]].\" But... the meaning is unclear.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's almost translated. Why aren't you happy?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''You tell me others are hearing things. They think it speaks to them. Yet I hear nothing. I feel nothing.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It's a new discovery.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is an important find. You said so yourself. Why does it matter what others say or feel?''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''I know. I see that it's important from a logical perspective. But what if I can't experience it? And this mention of worth... What if it means I'm not worthy?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What if the gods are not worthy of us? Look. We aren't done yet, right? So wait and see.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''You're right.''\n|-|It's natural to doubt.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's natural to have doubts. You've convinced me that this search for the past has a value beyond drachmae.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''That makes me happy. I just can't help but wonder what the gods think of me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think what's important is what you think of yourself.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''Thank you, hero.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to dust yourself off and focus.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''You're right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should carry on.''\n*'''Eppie:''' ''There are two locations to explore this time. There's a [[Burned Temple of Charites|temple]] in the [[City of Orchomenos]]. It's near the harbor. The other stele is difficult to pinpoint. There are ruins along the coastline, near the [[Site of Iphigenia's Sacrifice|altar]] for [[Iphigenia]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, then. And cheer up. We're almost done.''",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra walked past a [[tavern]] in northern Athens and encountered Alkibiades once more.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''You have the habit of appearing the moment I need you. What a power I may wield.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is there ever a time you don't need me?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Good point.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The drunk politician you had me take home... We ran into a bit of trouble.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''That's terrible! I'm glad to see you're OK.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If the politician had died=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm fine, but nature can be cruel. We were attacked by animals, and he was mauled to death.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I see. Well, plans change sometimes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You seem pretty accepting of this.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''What else can I do? We should both forget this ever happened. Pretend you never even saw the man.''\n|-|If Kassandra protected the politician=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, thankfully we both made it out alive.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Oh. I see. Thank you for telling me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You seem disappointed.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I'm just... impressed you were able to save the both of you.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra changed the subject.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said you needed something?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Ah, to business already? Fine, it's simple enough, really. There's an item that holds great sentimental value I'd like you to retrieve.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll get it for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do I need to find?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It's an ''[[wikt:olisbos|olisbos]].'' If you saw it on the ground, even you wouldn't bend over... to pick it up. But it means so much to me. To hold it again would mean more than you know.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're so sentimental.=\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''I never took you for someone who cared for sentimental things. ''\n*'''Alkibiades:''''' I'm so much more than my beautiful face and flowing blond locks...''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''Like what?''\n*'''Alkibiades:\u00a0'''''Well, let's see... People forget I'm an orphan\u2014that [[Perikles]] isn't my father.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''I know what it's like to lose family, too.''\n*'''Alkibiades:\u00a0'''''Ah. We have that in common. There's more to you than I thought, ''misthios''. Now, where were we?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're being dramatic.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That seems a bit emotional, even for you. You've gone soft.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I'm anything but ''soft,'' I assure you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Focus, Alkibiades. What is an ''olisbos?'' ''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It brings... pleasure. When my body grows too tired after a long night, having one of these can let the fun continue.''\n}}\n|-|Have someone else get it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then go get it.''\nKassandra returns.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I knew I'd see you again... But what I'd really like to see is my ''olisbos''.''\n(Back to dialogue choice one)\n</tabber>\n(If \"Why can't you get the ''olisbos'' yourself?\" was chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a big boy. Get it yourself?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I sure am... But there's a small chance the woman who has it won't exactly be happy to see me again.''\n(If \"What's so special about it?\" was chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There has to be a story behind this thing.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''When you see the ''olisbos,'' you'll know. When you have it in your hands, against your skin... When you feel the weight of it, you'll know.''\n(If \"Where do you get your stamina?\" was chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Every time we talk, it seems like you're about to sleep with someone... Or you want to... ''Or'' you've just finished. Is this woman the most recent one?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Who said I slept with her?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was a safe guess. How do you find time for anything else?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Determination, mostly.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''There's a closeness you can only feel with someone in those moments. Who wouldn't crave that?''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll go get it.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get the ''olisbos'' for you.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''There's a small chance the woman may wish to keep it for herself... to spite me. It may be best to go unseen and hurry back. She lives east of here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry, you'll have it in your hands soon.''\nKassandra infiltrated the nearby [[House of Solon]] and retrieved the stone olisbos from a chest.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's made out of stone... I guess that could work.''\nShe hurried back to Alkibiades.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Ah, that's it in your hand! You brought it. Hm, it's different than I remember it looking... And much bigger too. She's going to miss it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This was never yours, was it? You had me steal it.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''We didn't just steal an ''olisbos''\u2014we stole a family heirloom and a husband's confidence. Without it, he'll be focused on his wife instead of his business. I think she'll enjoy the change of pace.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're clever.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So it's sentimental... just not to you.''\n|-|I don't like liars.=\nKassandra got irritated.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You lied. Again.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I don't think I did. I was very particular with my words.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said it was sentimental.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It is. Just not to me. There wasn't a single lie.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not how it feels.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''The only thing that matters is you retrieved the ''olisbos'' and helped me a great deal.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what about me?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Now, now. We wash each other's backs, don't we? There's a reason you never turn me down, after all. How about I show you how this ''olisbos'' can make all the difference?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Let's do it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know, you've made me curious. Let's try it out.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I knew you'd be'' open ''to it.''\nThey entered the tavern to pleasure themselves using the ''olisbos''. After a couple of hours they went back outside fully dressed up again. Kassandra, feeling sore from the experience, tried to stretch and move around.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was... something''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It's different, but you'll get used to it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I hope you're right.''\nAlkibiades paid Kassandra for her help and left smiling.\n|-|Leave \u2013 I'll pass.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not what I meant. Guess I ''can'' turn you down after all.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I deserved that.''\nAlkibiades paid Kassandra for her help and left despondently.\n</tabber>",

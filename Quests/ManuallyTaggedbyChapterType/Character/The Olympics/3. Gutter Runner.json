    "Section_Dialogue": "On the street between the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] and the [[Olympic Tree]], a fidgety, topless bald [[Alopex|man]] approached Kassandra and addressed her.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Hey you,'' [[Mercenary|misthios]]! ''Would you like to learn about your future?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Yes, I would.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you. I would like to know what the [[Fates]] have planned for me.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''You would! Yes, of course you would. Everyone wants their future told by the Great Ouzo!''\nA [[Maia|girl]] wearing an orange {{Wiki|peplos}} snuck behind Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, what is it?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''I see great things...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Like what?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''You know things, and... it's going to be sunny tomorrow.''\nThe girl snatched a pouch of [[drachma]]e from Kassandra without her noticing.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Thank you, thank you. Tell your friends.''\n|-|Don't waste my time.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Praxithea|Oracle]] at [[Sanctuary of Delphi|Delphi]] ruined my life. You think I want to hear your lies, too?''\nA girl wearing an orange peplos snuck behind Kassandra.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''No worries! How about I clean your sandals?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nNo thank you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not today.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nKeep your hands off my sandals.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My sandals are fine.''\n}}\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Then what about your...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need anything. Go!''\nThe girl snatched a pouch of drachmae from Kassandra without her noticing.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Well, no accounting for taste, but suit yourself!''\n</tabber>\n\nThe man walked away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is it with the Olympics? Everyone's out to make drachmae...''\n[[File:ACOD_Gutter_Runner_-_Kassandra_spotting_the_child_thief.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra spotting the thief running away]]\nKassandra noticed her pouch was missing then quickly looked behind her and chased after the child.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka, ''my drachmae! Hey, stop, [[thief]]!''\nShe stopped for a moment after realizing the child seemed familiar.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like [[Phoibe]]... And as nimble a thief!''\nKassandra briefly lost track of the girl.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have to find her.''\nShe managed to track her down among the crowd in front of the [[Leonidaion]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hey, come back here! Thief!''\nThe girl ran away to the south entrance of Olympia nearby. Kassandra whispered to herself.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A street thief. Just like Phoibe...''\nThe girl took a left outside the entrance, down towards the back of the [[Stables of Olympia|stables]]. Kassandra chased her and discovered a group of children. She approached the girl, who'd stopped.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You led me on a good chase, but I caught you. Hand it over.''\n[[File:ACOD Kassandra catches Maia.png|thumb|250px|Maia caught by Kassandra]]\nThe girl looked frightened.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Hand what over?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My drachmae. Give it back.''\nMaia gingerly handed the pouch to Kassandra.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Here, please don't hurt me. They made me do it, I didn't want to, honest...''\nShe started to cry.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hush. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.''\n*'''Maia:''' ''But the [[Athenian Captain|Captain]] will!''\n\n(If \"Who's the Captain?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Captain?''\n*'''Maia:''' ''Yeah, it's him that makes us do this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Us?''\n*'''Maia:''' ''The other street kids!''\n\n(If \"Why's the Captain making you steal?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why is he making you steal?''\n*'''Maia:''' ''For the drachmae, stupid!''\nKassandra replied sharply.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You should be more polite to adults.''\nMaia put her hands on her hips.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Why? What've adults done for me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fair enough.''\n\n(If \"I'll find the Captain.\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like this Captain needs a good talking to.''\n*'''Maia:''' ''Don't talk, just hit. He even stole my'' mater's ''necklace from me... Says I'll get it back if I steal for him. It's all that I had left of her...''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Let me help you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you get your necklace.''\n*'''Maia:''' ''Why would you care?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You remind me of someone... Someone very special.''\n|-|You need to stand up for yourself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't rely on me or others for help. You need to learn to solve your own problems.''\n*'''Maia:''' ''Thanks for nothing,'' mal\u00e1ka!\nKassandra returned.\n*'''Maia:''' ''What do you want?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did you need me to do?''\n*'''Maia:''' ''Get my necklace and save my friends from the Captain... But you'll probably just disappoint me again.''\n</tabber>\n\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to Maia once more.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Did you get my necklace from the Captain? Where are my friends? Did you help them? Was there a fight? Why are you standing there? Did you do'' anything?\n\nKassandra left the girl and rode to [[Endymion Camp]] in [[Psophis Foothills]]. She infiltrated the camp and found three cages holding children.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Keeping children in cages? Whoever did this will pay.''\nShe overheard the captain and a man talking to each other.\n*'''[[Athens|Athenian]] Heavy Soldier:''' ''Why do I feed those little shits? Let 'em steal their own food.''\nKassandra recognized the other man as the one who distracted her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's that'' mal\u00e1ka ''I saw in the market. He must be in on this scheme.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Well, Captain, if you don't feed them, they'll be too weak to run away with the loot. If they get caught, you'll have to train new ones.''\n*'''Athenian Heavy Soldier:''' ''You want me to give them your food? Maybe I should beat you more, set an example for the brats.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Please, no. I was just trying to help. It's in your interest to keep them healthy and...''\n*'''Athenian Heavy Soldier:''' ''I don't need street scum like you telling me what's in my interest.''\n*'''Athenian Heavy Soldier:''' ''You think this is a game? You're supposed to bring me'' drachmae, ''not excuses!''\n\nKassandra sneaked into the camp but was spotted by the captain. His demeanor instantly changed and the bald man crouched in fear.\n\n*'''Athenian Heavy Soldier:''' ''You! Get the fuck out of my camp before I beat you like the dog that you are.''\nKassandra killed the captain and took the necklace of Maia's mother from his corpse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be Maia's necklace...'' Mal\u00e1ka ''kept it on him.''\nShe freed the children and approached the other man.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Please, I only wanted to help the children. Spare me, and I'll do better. I'll look after them all.''\n\nKassandra debated on whether to execute him or not and quickly reached a decision.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should return to Maia.''\nKassandra returned to Maia.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I got something for you.''\nThe girl was overjoyed.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Thank you, thank you, thank you! What happened to Alopex?''\nKassandra knelt down in front of her.\n*'''Maia:''' ''You know, the guy who distracted you while I nabbed your purse!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Alopex dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I had to kill him. He was a partner in this. He could have enslaved you all again.''\nMaia was crestfallen.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Oh...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have to move on now, but I'm glad I could help.''\n*'''Maia:''' ''What? I...''\nKassandra stood up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's all right. You don't have to thank me. Take care, Maia.''\n|-|Alopex alive.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I spared him. He's promised to help you and the others.''\n*'''Maia:''' ''Good, I always liked him. He used to share his food with us and stand up for us when the Athenian got mad!''\nKassandra stood up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll do fine. Take care.''\n</tabber>\nRegardless, Maia was grateful.\n*'''Maia:''' ''Thanks for saving us from the Athenian. Now we get to keep everything we steal!''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra retrieved her money, as well as the necklace of Maia's mother, freeing the girl and her friends from the clutches of the Athenian Captain.",
    "Section_Trivia": "If players retrieve the necklace before starting this quest, they skip the dialogue with the soldiers and tell Maia that Alopex was spared.\n\nIf Elis is controlled by the Spartans during this mission, the soldiers will kill the Athenian-allied Captain prior to the player's arrival, removing the option to talk with Alopex.",

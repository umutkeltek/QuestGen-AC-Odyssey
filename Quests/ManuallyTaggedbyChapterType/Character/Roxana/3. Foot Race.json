    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra and Roxana arrived at the latter's [[Hydrea Apple Farm|house]].\n<tabber>\n|-|Returned immediately=\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Shall we continue?''\n|-|Returned later=\n*'''Roxana:''' ''The champion returns.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now that we've saved the children of [[Hydrea]] from a pack of hungry [[Wolf|wolves]], I guess we can move on?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You jest, but that was a real nuisance we dealt with. Your choices have an impact, Kassandra - your actions have already benefited the people here.<br>So, shall we complete our training?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We do have unfinished business.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''The training... or the company?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm here to train.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want to finish this training - that's it.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''All business, eh, champion? You need to loosen up once in a while.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe after this next challenge.''\n\n|-|I'm here for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've been having so much fun.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Fighting each other... Killing wolves...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go on...''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I think you'll like this next challenge.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Roxana:''' ''We're going to have a foot race. First one to the [[Lover's Leap|high point]] on the island wins.''\n(If players choose \"What do you mean, foot race?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The last part of training is a race?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''The Battle of One Hundred Hands is about skill, strength, and most of all, ''endurance''. A tired competitor is an easy target for someone with stamina. I make regular offerings to [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]] to stay fast.''\n(If players choose \"What do I win?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And if I win this race, what will I get?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Bragging rights alone.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Great.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''It's not the result you should be after, it's the training. After this, you will be ready to enter the Battle of One Hundred Hands. I will vouch for you, and you will vouch for me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready. You said race to the high point-''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Yes! The plateau on the other side of [[Small settlement|town]]. When I say go, the race is on. Three... Two... One...<br>Go!''\nThe two women began running towards Lover's Leap.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Come on, champion! Is that all you've got?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's not over yet!''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You'll need to move faster in the Battle, champion!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm pacing myself!''\nKassandra managed to overtake Roxana.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought you'd be faster!''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Just enjoying the view!''\nKassandra [[Freerunning|freeran]] across the town to increase her lead.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Now you're just showing off!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Should I slow down?''\nKassandra reached the high point, with Roxana arriving shortly thereafter.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You're fast, even with all that gear.''\nKassandra turned and admired the view.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's easy to forget how beautiful it is here.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''When you're training so hard, you mean?''\n(If players choose \"No, when you're driven to find closure.\")<!--Only available if spoken to Drakios first-->\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm trying to restore balance to my life, and to the [[Greece|Greek]] world. To find closure. But there are [[Cult of Kosmos|people]] standing in my way I must take care of first, and I think winning the Battle of One Hundred Hands will help.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''What makes you think that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Call it a hunch.''\n(If players choose \"No, when you're driven by drachmae.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I travel a lot, but it's often at the service of others. I can be so focused on [[drachma]]e that I lose sight of what's in front of me.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''And what's that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The ocean breeze on my face. The [[sun]] on my skin. A sturdy [[horse]] to ride.''\n(If players choose \"Yes, it's the training.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All this training leaves no time for fun.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I can tell you're holding something back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''...Maybe.''\nThey were silent for a moment, and Roxana turned to face the view as well, stepping closer to the cliff.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I come up here to remind myself to live in the moment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can see how that might work.''\nThe two women continued to chat long past sundown, laughing and relaxed.\n<tabber>\n|-|If nothing particular done?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you told [[Barnabas]] there was a sea monster living in your ear, he'd believe you.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''He sounds like a real dimwit.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Actually, he's one of the most genuine people I've ever met.''\n|-|If Empedokles-questchain completed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm telling you, [[Empedokles|he]] was never fully dressed. And some people on [[Kythera Island|Kythera]] built a [[Statue of Empedokles|statue]] to this man.<br>''Mal\u00e1kas'' Empedokles.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''What became of him?''\nKassandra looked away, her smile dying.\n</tabber>\n*'''Roxana:''' ''That's [[Melos]] island right there. Where so many warriors go to die.<br>At the Battle, we may have to fight each other. And only one of us will survive.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Let's not talk about that.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought you came up here to live in the moment?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''How's this for in the moment?''\nRoxana leaned closer.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nIt'll do.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's make it more than a moment.''\nThe two women kissed.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Must you wear so many layers?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Comes with the job, I guess.''\nAfter spending the night together, Kassandra and Roxana awoke the following morning.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I guess this is goodbye. Until the Battle, I mean.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Let's not make this difficult.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't help thinking... we don't have to cross swords.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You could skip the Battle as easy as I can. But you won't.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right.''\nThe two women stepped closer, embracing each other.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Goodbye, Roxana.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI don't feel that way about you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry, Roxana. I don't want to do this.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You're right. Getting closer could mean a half second's hesitation before killing you... You're tough, I know that. I can't give up any edge.''\nKassandra got up and prepared to depart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was good to meet you, Roxana, but it's time to get back to the real world. Good luck in the Battle.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You too, champion.''\n}}\n\n|-|You will be the one who dies.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've killed more soldiers, [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and masked men than I can remember. The day of the Battle will be like any other for me.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You don't know what I'm capable of. You don't know how different it will be from my average day.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know one way it'll differ.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''How's that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will be shorter.''\nKassandra got up and prepared to depart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was good to meet you, Roxana, but it's time to get back to the real world. Good luck in the Battle.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You too, champion.''\n</tabber>",

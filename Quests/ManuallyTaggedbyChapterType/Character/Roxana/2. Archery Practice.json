    "Section_Dialogue": "After sparring with Roxana, Kassandra accompanied her to the [[Hydrea Shipwreck|shipwreck]] on the coast of [[Hydrea]], which had been occupied by a pack of [[Wolf|wolves]].\n\n(Went to shipwreck immediately)\n*'''Roxana:''' ''We're a safe distance here. Now shoot these cursed wolves before they start taking down the local children. I'll see if there isn't a thing or two I can learn from you.''\n(Went to shipwreck later)\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You came! Good. We can get on with the training.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said we'd be doing archery... but I don't see any targets.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''A ship wrecked here not long ago. It carried a pack of wolves to [[Melos]] as an added challenge to the Battle of One Hundred Hands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And now they're running loose here on Hydrea?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Not for long.<br>Show me what you can do with that [[bow]] and put them down. Maybe I can learn a thing or two.''\n\nRegardless, Kassandra commented on Roxana's choice for training.\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt \u2013 This time with you is nice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's nice to be out here, just the two of us.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Is that right?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There were a lot of onlookers when we sparred.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You'll be happy to know the rest of our training will be more... private.''\n|-|The wolves are no problem.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A few wolves shouldn't be much trouble.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''These wolves were trained to be part of the Battle of One Hundred Hands, to ''attack'' and kill people. We can't have them running loose on [[Hydrea]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n|-|The wolves are a menace.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We can't have so many wolves on an island this small. They'll terrorize the people living here.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''That's exactly right, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. That's why we're here.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''On with the [[Hunting|hunt]]\u2014I can always use more pelts.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''A true champion. I knew it! Ready your bow.''\nKassandra began taking aim at the animals.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Look at you, all statuesque as you draw your bow.''\nKassandra slayed one of the wolves.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How'd you like that one?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Beautiful shot.''\nAnother one of the wolves fell.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''The way your muscles ripple when you draw the string\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do they ripple?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Do they ''ripple''.<br>They're works of art!''\n\n:(If players entered melee)\n:*'''Roxana:''' ''What are you doing? This is supposed to be archery training!''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you want the wolves killed, or not?''\n:*'''Roxana:''' ''Yes. Kill them.''\n\nWith the wolves dead, Roxana commented on the results of their training.\n<tabber>\n|-|(Performed to Roxana's standards)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's done. All the wolves are dead.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You elevate archery to an art form. Even [[Sophokles]] couldn't captivate me like that.''\n|-|(Did not perform to Roxana's standards)=\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Not exactly the archery training I was hoping for.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The wolves are dead. That's what matters.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''If you say so.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How much more \"''training''\" will we do before I can enter the Battle?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''What, you don't want to spend more time with me?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I'm enjoying this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This time with you has been-<br>I don't know what to say.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Say no more. In a strange way, I see my own reflection in you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes. We've only just met and yet, we have a... connection.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You're a unique creature, Kassandra.<br>There's one more step to our training.''\n|-|I have other priorities.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have other things to do. People to kill.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Then you'll be happy to know we only have one last step in our training regimen.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where to?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''My [[Hydrea Apple Farm|house]].''",

    "General_Description": "'''Sparring with Roxana''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra encountered a fierce warrior named [[Roxana]] who was preparing for the [[Battle of One Hundred Hands]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "While exploring [[Hydrea]], Kassandra heard a number of conversations.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''This is Roxana's year. She's going to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands for sure.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''What? She doesn't even have an official training partner.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''It's because she's too good for any of them!''\nShe arrived at a [[Hydrea Apple Farm|farm]].\n*'''Civilian 3:''' ''Roxana nearly killed my son when they sparred this week.''\n*'''Civilian 4:''' ''He's lucky. Had it been in the Battle she would have killed him.''\n*'''Civilian 3:''' ''...Yeah.''\n[[File:ACOD Sparring with Roxana 2.png|thumb|250px|Roxana knocking out her partner]]\nKassandra arrived at a training area near the farm, where a woman was berating her sparring partners.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You amateurs are wasting my time.''\nKassandra approached as the woman knocked out one of her sparring partners.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These men look like they need a [[doctor]].''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''They're lousy sparring partners, every last one. I need professionals to practice with before the Battle of One Hundred Hands. I need a champion.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm your champion.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe your \"champion\" has arrived.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Is that right? If you're serious, I'm a sanctioned competitor in the battle. You practice with me, and [[Drakios]] will let both of us officially enter.''\n|-|I'm a humble misthios.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm just a working ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]'', not a \"champion\". Still, I might be able to help you with your problem.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Well, I won't be able to pay you in any traditional way, but I am a sanctioned competitor in the Battle. If you train with me, we can both officially enter.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This battle-''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''The Battle of One Hundred Hands is the most grueling contest in the [[Greece|Greek]] world. The body count is high, and the chance of success low. Are you sure that's something you want to train for?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Killing is my specialty.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing's what I do, and I do it well.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You have the right attitude, I'll give you that. But you can't simply power your way to victory in the Battle of One Hundred Hands. It takes preparation.''\n|-|I'll do my best.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm prepared to work hard. The rest lies with the [[Fates]].''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Humility is a fine trait in a warrior\u2014as long as it's hiding true ferocity below the surface. That's what's needed in the Battle.''\n</tabber>\n(If players asked \"Why do you want to fight in the Battle?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If this battle is so difficult, why enter it at all?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I'm not from a family of means, champion, and have always dreamed about the Hundred-Hands purse. My father, my brother tried to win it years ago. Even my mother entered last time, and now they're all gone. Dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want the [[drachma]]e.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I don't care about the drachmae, not now. I need to save my family's legacy from the edge of yet another champion's blade - I need to win and become like a hero of old.''\n(If players asked \"What makes you think you can win?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the battle's so hard, why do you think you'll win?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I train at all hours until my body gives out. Before bed, I make offerings to [[Ares]]. I wake in the night to strategize. And then... I rise in the morning to do it all again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's an impressive amount of work.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''If I don't win the Battle, at least I'll know I've done all I can.''\n(If players asked \"Where's Drakios?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mentioned I should talk to Drakios about officially entering the Battle. Where can I find him?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''He's usually in the town on [[Melos]] - doesn't go far.''\n(If players chose \"I think I can handle the Battle.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's say I want to fight in the Battle of One Hundred Hands...''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Then fight me and prove you are a worthy training companion.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"Let's fight.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You asked for it.''\nThe two women drew their weapons and began to spar.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Come on, ''misthios.\nRoxana managed to strike Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' That'' hurt''.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Ooh, I've made you angry.<br>Stings, doesn't it, champion?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've felt worse.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You're cute when you're angry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What?''\nRoxana giggled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not angry.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Of course not.'' \nThe match continued.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''You need to push me!<br>Are you even trying?<br>Nice move.''\n[[File:ACOD Sparring with Roxana 5.png|thumb|250px|Roxana being helped up by Kassandra]]\nKassandra eventually defeated Roxana and knocked her down. She sheathed her weapons and offered her hand. Roxana grasped it and Kassandra helped her up to her feet.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''It seems you ''are'' the champion I've been looking for. A real [[Sparta]]n, if I'm right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You are.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''I sensed it in the way you fought. Aggressive, but not reckless.<br>My name's Roxana.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Next on the agenda is archery training. Are you ready?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 Let's do it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''So eager! Well, a shipment of [[Wolf|wolves]] has [[Hydrea Shipwreck|wrecked]] on shore nearby. They were meant to be part of the Battle, but now, they're our practice targets.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go hunting.''\nKassandra left with Roxana to hunt the wolves.\n|-|Not right now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have other things to attend to first.''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''When you're ready, there's a shipwreck on the north coast of the island. Meet me there.''\nRoxana took her leave, hinting a mild annoyance at the delay, to which Kassandra raised an eyebrow. She eventually met up with her at the shipwreck.\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra and Roxana became training partners in preparation for the Battle of One Hundred Hands.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*The game used to have a bug wherein this quest was rendered unavailable if Roxana was spoken to before speaking with Drakios and getting the [[Call to Arms (Melos)|Call to Arms]] quest, only leaving the option to pay to start [[The Great Contender]]. After patch 1.06 this quest was rendered completely unavailable, even if the player had acquired Call to Arms before setting foot on the Hydrea island.\n*As of October 2019, the quest no longer bugs, and the questchain is possible to complete even before talking with Drakios.",

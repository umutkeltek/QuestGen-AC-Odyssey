    "Section_Description": "At the suggestion of [[Diona]], Kassandra sought out her [[Glaukos|associate]] at the [[Tavern, Kythera|tavern]] in [[Skandeia Harbor]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to Skandeia Harbor, finding the tavern and the Diona's acerbic associate therein.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I take it you're the harbor master.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''I told you, I'll pay when I get paid!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Diona sent me. She said you needed help.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Diona? Wait, wait, wait. Who are you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm just helping her out. She has some information I want.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Liar! I bet you want ''her'' more than you want information, don't you?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just tell me what needs to be done.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''You think you can do better than I have?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''As a matter of fact, I do.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Fine! You want to prove yourself to Diona, right? The military has been a real pain in the ass lately.<br>They've captured some [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] who are of interest to her at the [[Phoinikeos Customs Warehouse|fortified warehouse]]. She needs you to free them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see to it, but it's going to cost you.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Ha! If you make it back alive, I'll fatten your pockets with [[drachma]]e myself.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Deal. But first, I have some questions.''\n(If players asked \"Why free the prisoners?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Freeing prisoners sounds treasonous. Why would she want to do that?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''In her paranoia, the [[Eritha|High Priestess]] has ordered anyone suspicious to be detained. But these prisoners were mercenaries minding their own business.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A mercenary's business is rarely their own.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Still, Diona wants them to help fight against her enemies.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And let me guess, the only ones she can trust are those who can be bought with drachmae.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Exactly. Of course, she trusts me too.''\n(If players asked \"Who's Diona to you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is Diona someone special to you?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''I-I'm her lover! And I'll be the one to help her get rid of her enemies! I promised that in exchange for -<br>Why am I telling you any of this?!<br>I don't care what you ''think'' your relationship with her is, she's just using you. I'm her true love!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right. You keep telling yourself that.''\n:(If already freed \u2013 \"Describe the men to me.\")\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Describe these mercenaries to me.''\n:*'''Glaukos:''' ''They're all massive brutes. The kind you approach when you want things done.''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds familiar. I saved some earlier. As brutish as they come, and not a hair on their heads.''\n:(Dialogue continues below at \"There were three of them...\")\n(Leave \u2013 \"That's enough\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've got enough to go on. You better get my drachmae ready.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Come back when you're done. If you make it out of the camp alive.''\nKassandra scanned the Customs Warehouse for the three men with the help of [[Ikaros]]. She found one in the warehouse itself;\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found him!''\none in the corner by the sea;\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's over there.''\nand the final one in the cages near the tents in the middle.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There he is!''\n[[File:ACOD All Bonds Will Break 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the prisoners]]\nShe infiltrated the fort, and made her way to the prisoner near the sea.\n*'''Greek Brute:''' ''I won't die here, ''misthios.'' Let me out!''\nShe released him and made her way to the second, in the cages in the middle.\n*'''Greek Brute:''' ''Get me out of here. Quick, before the [[guard]]s return!''\nShe released him as well and made her way to the prisoner in the warehouse itself.\n*'''Greek Brute:''' ''They'll execute me! I did nothing wrong!''\nShe freed the final mercenary.\n\nHaving freed all of the mercenaries, Kassandra made her way out of the warehouse area and returned to Glaukos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've freed the prisoners at the military camp.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''There were three of them, did you get them all?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, three of them in all their balding glory.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Guess you're more useful than you look. In that case, Diona needs one more task fulfilled.<br>A man needs to die.''\n(If players chose \"Tell me more.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm listening.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Diona's enemies have forces on [[Chytra Atoll]]. They're going to use it as a staging area to launch attacks on [[Kythera Island|Kythera]].<br>You need to exterminate these pests.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That sounds difficult.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to go alone to an island swarming with enemies?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Oh, is that too hard a task for Diona's new champion?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tread lightly.''\n|-|Too easy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will wipe the enemy off the face of that island.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Your humility is moving, ''misthios''. But I wouldn't underestimate them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, it's ''you'' who underestimates ''me.\n</tabber>\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Enough pointless chatter!<br>She needs you to take out the captain there. His men should disperse after that. But, still, leave none alive. Will you do it?''\n:(If already killed)\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''The captain? I slayed a very... flamboyantly dressed man earlier by a shipwreck.''\n:*'''Glaukos:''' ''That sounds like him. All that peacocking, no doubt to catch Diona's eye.<br>Here, take your payment and go. I have no need for you anymore.''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hold on. You've been fighting for Diona against the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]]. Tell me everything you know about them.''\n:(Dialogue continues at \"What Cult?\")\n[[File:ACOD All Bonds Will Break 4.png|thumb|250px|Glaukos requesting Kassandra kill the captain]]\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll handle it.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Consider it done. What more can you tell me?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''What more could you possibly need? Just kill the man.''\n(If players asked \"Where is the captain hiding?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any idea where I can find the captain?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''That rat should be somewhere around the [[Shipwreck Campsite|shipwreck]] off the north coast of Chytra Atoll.<br>I led a small party that managed to maroon his ship, but we couldn't finish the job. He and his men will be on their guard.''\n(If players asked \"How do I get to Chytra Atoll?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is the quickest way to Chytra Atoll?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Sail south from the southern tip of Kythera until you come across a shipwreck.''\n(If players chose \"Tell me about the Cult.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me what you know about the Cult.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''What Cult?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Isn't the captain a Cultist?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''He could be a ''mal\u00e1kas'' god for all I care. Diona says he wants to destroy her for rejecting him.<br>That the only way for us to be together is if I remove him from the picture.<br>Aren't you here for the same reason? To win her over?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Lie \u2013 Of course.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's already mine. And after I slay the captain, which ''you'' failed to do, you'll be forgotten.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''You couldn't have done it without my help! Diona will appreciate all I've done for her!<br>She can't just\u2014<br>J-Just forget about me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be sure she does.''\n|-|Her sister is more my type.= <!--If The Handmaiden's Story already done-->\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Truth be told, her sister is more my type.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''You better not let Diona hear that. She's a jealous one. She's spent her life living in her sister's shadow.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why isn't Diona the High Priestess?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Because all anyone cares about is who's the first born.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''True.''\n|-|No, I'm here for the Cult.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here to dismantle the Cult of Kosmos. I have no time or interest in the Priestess.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''You can't fool me with your \"Cult\" bullshit. No one can resist Diona's charm.''<br>And'' no one would ever call themselves that. ''Mal\u00e1kas \"Cult of Kosmos.\"\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever.''\n</tabber>\n(Leave \u2013 That's enough.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all I need to know.''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''We'll send a fat amount of drachmae to your [[Adrestia|ship]] when you're done.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Excellent.''\n\nRegardless, Glaukos petulantly shooed Kassandra away.\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Go! Get out of here! And don't you go talking to Diona anymore!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Or what?''\n*'''Glaukos:''' ''Or I'll\u2014Ugh, just go!''\n\n([[Atoll Order]] completion quote)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These don't look like Cult members. Probably just well-paid mercenaries.''",

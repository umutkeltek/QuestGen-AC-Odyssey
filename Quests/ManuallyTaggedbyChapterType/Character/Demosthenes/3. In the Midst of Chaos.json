He used his wits to triumph. Wily Odysseus, they call him. Without him, the [[Trojan War|Trojan war]] would have been lost. And the other generals understood that.''\n(If players choose \"What do you see in your future?\")\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''What do you think your future holds?''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''Victory or death. You don't stay a general for long if you don't win battles.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''I suppose many generals die on the field.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''Not the majority. The Athenian people are the greatest threat to a general's life. If you displease them, they'll remove you from office. Ostracize you. Or even condemn you to death.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''And you want this job?''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''There is no greater purpose than the glory of Athens. It's my duty and my honor.''\n(If players choose \"Why are you always here?\")\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''Why is it I always find you here?''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''[[Athena]] is the goddess of wisdom. And war. What better place for a general to ask for blessings?''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''You don't seem very devout to me.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''I'm not the first general in my family. My father was as well, and his father before him.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''You would have learned military thinking from a young age.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''Exactly. My grandfather brought me here when I was a child. He stood me here and told me Athena was our patron. That we must always offer her our respect on the eve of war.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''He sounds like a wise man.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''He was. He died in battle the next day.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''You come here to remember him.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''And to remember that though the gods may be our patrons, they will not always protect us.''\n(Leave - \"I have what I need.\")\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''I know enough.''\n(If players already have the seals.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Since you're being so polite, I already have them.''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''And the other generals dare to doubt me! There's no way Neon can take credit for this one.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's taken credit before?''\n*'''Demosthenes:''' ''You could say that. However, I'm the one who hired you. I have more work for you, if you're ready.''\nKassandra returns with the seals.\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''Do you have my seals yet?''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''Why yes, I do.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''Good. The Spartans will soon realize someone is picking off their senior commanders.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''Probably, but they haven't caught me yet.''\n*'''Demosthenes:\u00a0'''''Interested in more work?''\n\n(Dialogue continues to start the next quest.)",

And then we ran them aground.''\n(If players choose \"How goes the war?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So I take it the war is going well for you, then?''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Enough questions.''\n(If players choose \"What will you do if you win?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What will you do if you win?''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Enough talk.''\n(If players choose \"OK. No more questions.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine. I won't ask any more questions.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Tell me then, Eagle Bearer, you must be pleased with our progress.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''As you said, tactics will win this.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''When this is over, I'll try my hand at politics.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure it'll suit you.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Go then, kill the enemy command. This is our war to win.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do it, General.''\nKassandra returns to Lysander.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have the seals. Spartan troops have the outpost.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''While you were gone, I oversaw the capture of three thousand. Yet still my men suck their thumbs.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Three thousand prisoners?''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Not anymore. They've been executed. Do you disapprove?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|War is war.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They'd do it to us.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''So we understand one another then.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Perfectly.''\n|-|Our actions are our legacy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Our actions live on long after we're dead.''\nLysander turns infuriated.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Don't you dare lecture me, Eagle Bearer. The gods approve of my actions.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then I'll leave you to the gods.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Your Spartan blood boils, does it?''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These seals should provide you ample proof.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''My command on the battlefield has been more than secured.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're welcome.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''We're well-positioned for battle. Troops have been deployed and will control more ground soon. Your efforts were invaluable. I won't forget it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you, General.''",

    "Section_Description": "[[Lysander]], a [[Sparta]]n [[Spartan army|general]], had a plan how to win the [[Peloponnesian War|war]]. To do this, he tasked Kassandra to weaken the [[Athens|Athenians]] by killing the ''[[polemarch]]oi'' of three [[fort]]s.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra noticed a Spartan commander at the foot of [[Leonidas I of Sparta|Leonidas]]' statue atop his [[Tomb of Leonidas|tomb]], lecturing\u00a0his [[soldier]]s.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''We'll not be outmaneuvered by the Athenians the way the [[Iran|Persians]] [[Battle of Thermopylae|did]] to Leonidas.''\n\nKassandra approached him.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''You're not one of my soldiers. You better have a good reason for being here.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I don't need a reason.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need a reason, good or otherwise.''\nLysander laughed.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Ah. Some bite to you, is there?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''More than some cowering [[dog]].''\nLysander guffawed.\n|-|We Spartans stick together.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We Spartans stand together. So here I am.''\nLysander loosened up.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Yes. Spartan blood matters most.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like this victory will bring you glory.''\nLysander stood proudly.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''The rewards of skill and effort!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's the Spartan way.''\n</tabber>\nLysander paused briefly then spoke.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''From [[helot|slave]] to general, bathing in the blood of this war, while our leaders stuff their faces and preen.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The polemarchs believe it's an easy victory.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''I will end this war in my favor.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have a strategy?''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Athenian polemarchs are paralyzed with indecision. They serve too many masters.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0''' ''Making them slow to react.''\n*'''Lysander:\u00a0''' ''And that's where you come in. Infiltrate their forts and kill their polemarchs. I need the way clear for my troops.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll kill the polemarchs)\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0''' ''I'll do my part. Consider the commanders already dead.''\n*'''Lysander:\u00a0''' ''Bring me their Athenian seals as proof. You'll be rewarded for your efforts.''\nIn time, Kassandra eventually completed the task and returned to Lysander.\n*'''Lysander:\u00a0''' ''The blood of the enemy will show our leaders that my strategy is the right one.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0''' ''These seals should help convince them.''\n*'''Lysander:\u00a0''' ''You've done well. Our troops are on the move.''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0''' ''They underestimate Spartans.''\n*'''Lysander:\u00a0''' ''They consider me much lower than a Spartan.''\n\n(Dialogue continues in the next quest.)",

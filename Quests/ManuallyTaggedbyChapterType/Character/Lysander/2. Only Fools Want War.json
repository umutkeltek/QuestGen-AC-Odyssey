Ready to kill more of their fort commanders?''\n(Accept \u2013 )\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll kill the commanders and clear the way for your troops.''\nLysander changed his tone.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Only fools want war. And so far it seems both sides are made of fools.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good news, General?''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Athenian commanders have been dismissed for negligence because of my tactics!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Better unemployed than dead.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''You're proving a solid ally. There's no time to lose. We need to control the enemy forts..''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let me ask you something first...''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Waste of time!''\n(If players asked \"What do you think of Spartan generals?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't think much of Spartan leadership.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''When I rise, they'll bow.''\n(Leave \u2013 )\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Chaire.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Why are you still here? Go kill the enemy command!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Consider it done.''\n\nKassandra returned to the general after finishing her task.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The fort commanders are dead. Here are the seals as proof.''\nLysander spread his arms and proudly said:\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Excellent. Our ineffectual leaders will see my value.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure they will.''\nLysander leans a bit closer.\n*'''Lysander:''' ''My spies tell me Athenians have gained ground. Infiltrate the forts and attack their command. Understand?''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll attack the commanders.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes. I'll do as you ask and attack the commanders.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They must be faltering by now.''\n*'''Lysander:''' ''Athenians fail because they fear risk.''\n(Dialogue continues to start the next quest.)",

    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Mikkos]] north of [[Myrina]] in [[Lemnos]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra docked at Myrina and a civilian hailed her as she disembarked.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''The Eagle Bearer?'' [[Mercenary|Misthios]]! ''Over here, I need to talk to you!''\nKassandra approached the man.\n*'''Civilian:''' Misthios! ''And that looks like [[Barnabas]]' ship.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''In fact it\u2014''\nBarnabas came up behind Kassandra.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Ah! That ship belongs to the Eagle Bearer now. Legendary ''misthios'', famed across the Greek world. I am just her humble servant.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Barnabas! You're back!''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''In the flesh. A little older, but not a bit wiser.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''[[Mikkos]] sent me here to wait for your return. It's about [[Neleus]]...''\nBarnabas rolled his one good eye.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Here we go. What has my nephew gotten himself into this time?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I think the trouble is real, Barnabas. You should go to him. Mikkos told me not to return without help, and I mean not to.''\nBarnabas raised a finger.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I need to think. But one thing... I know my nephew. Ah yes. He's fine, that much is certain. I'll be on the ship.''\nBarnabas walked back towards the ship.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''And you, ''misthios''? I need ''someone'' to go see about Neleus.''\n(If players choose \"Why doesn't Barnabas believe you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why doesn't Barnabas think something is wrong with his nephew?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''It's just... Neleus was a legendary nuisance growing up. He lied. He cheated. He brawled and broke things.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Some of us grow out of that.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Well, now Neleus is a serious athlete, training to be an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion. And what's more, he's ''family'' to Barnabas.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That ''is'' important.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll see what's going on.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help Barnbas' nephew however I can.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Neleus lives with his caretaker, Mikkos. Their house is just up the hill north of here.''\nKassandra travelled to [[Mikkos' House]]. As she approached, she heard a loud argument coming from inside the house.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''The amount of times this boy's been \"too sick to work\" only to hear, ''not two hours later'', he's in the fields with his friends. By [[Zeus]]!''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''He's grown since you've been gone. He's not a kid anymore.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Ah, but still up to his old tricks, if you ask me.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Listen to reason, Barnabas. I saw him vomiting myself. And now he's like this!''\nKassandra entered the house to see Barnabas and Mikkos standing over Neleus, who lay on a mat on the ground.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''He's faking it, Mikkos. I've seen this routine before. Gods! Grant me [[Penelope]]'s patience.''\nNeleus groaned in his sleep.\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''It's not just Neleus. There have been others. All promising young athletes turning up sick or missing. Something's not right in [[Thasos]].''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''What goes on across Thasos is not my concern. But I know my nephew. Ah, yes. He practically ''worships'' at the altar of [[Aergia]]. A devotee of sloth and idleness, he is.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Help me talk sense into him, ''misthios.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Neleus needs tough love.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know your nephew best, and it sounds like he needs a firm hand.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I thought his caretaker could handle him, but apparently I was wrong.''\nThey all looked at Neleus, who kept groaning.\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Come on Barnabas, he's plainly ill.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Bah! I'll be at the ship when Neleus snaps out of it.''\n|-|Try a gentle approach.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe you should be a bit easier on your nephew this time. He really does seem sick.''\nBarnabas shook his head sadly as Neleus groaned again.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Ah, you're right. I\u2013I guess I didn't want it to be true. He's not a boy anymore, I can see that.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''He may be grown, but he still needs help.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''There's only one way I know how.''\nBarnabas walked out of the house, pausing at the door only to give Kassandra and Mikkos his parting instructions.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Let me know if there is any change in his condition. I'll be at the ship making offerings to [[Asklepios]].''\n</tabber>\nBarnabas left. Kassandra turned back to Mikkos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give Barnabas some time.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''But our time may run out. I have more leads to follow up on, but with Neleus like this I can't leave his side. Maybe you could help me?''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll help.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Barnabas is like family to me. I want to do anything I can to help Neleus.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Thank you.''\nMikkos relaxed.\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''You know, it's not often a beautiful and capable misthios comes to this house.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt \u2013 Must have been the Fates.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They may have brought Neleus sickness, but the [[Fates]] have brought us together...''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''I'd hate to get sick someday and think of all the fun I didn't have.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But first, there are those leads you mentioned.''\n|-|Not now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We shouldn't talk like this with Neleus in this condition. Now, about those leads you mentioned...''\n</tabber>\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Well, someone at the [[Champion's Gymnasium]] must know something.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''[[Aietes]] was the last one to be with Neleus when he was well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They were friends?''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''They were. If he doesn't know anything, you could talk to the doctor at the quarry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If he's the local doctor, he's bound to know something.''\n(If players choose \"What more can you tell me about the Champion's Gymnasium?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What more can you tell me about this gymnasium? You say other athletes have disappeared?''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Many, yes. A lot of the athletes came here to train from elsewhere across the Greek world, so when they disappear, people think they maybe just went home.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A convenient story if something bad were happening to them.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Exactly.''\n(If players choose \"Where is the quarry?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like to have a word with that doctor at the quarry.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''The [[Aliki Quarry]] is at the southern point of Thasos. The doctor there is mixed up with training athletes and the workers.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like a strange connection.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Yes, until you realize half of the workers are athletes who have given up on their training. Something's happened to them, and that doctor is the only connection I see.''\n(If players choose \"Where can I find Aietes?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The last person to see Neleus before he got sick was Aietes. Where can I find him?''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''He's an aspiring athlete, too, but nowhere near as talented as Neleus. He trains alone on the outskirts of the [[Vineyard of Glory]]. You're sure to find him there.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll look into these leads.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll follow up on these leads and check back when I know what's going on.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''. And feel free to \"check back\" any time.''\n\n(The player can talk to Mikkos again in the house)\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''You're back! Neleus hasn't gotten any better. But maybe you're here to see me instead?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm here for you (Flirt)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've been thinking about you and wanted to see you again. I won't pretend otherwise.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''You've stormed into my life like a creature from the summit of Olympus itself. It's safe to say I've been thinking about you, too.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should probably leave our feelings aside...for now.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''For the sake of Neleus.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes.''\n|-|Now is not the time.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We can't do this now.''\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''I know, I know. It's just -''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happened to Neleus is still an open question. I need to get to work.''\n|-|I have questions.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have some questions.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Mikkos:''' ''Is there anything I can do to help?''\n(goes back to the questions above)",

Strangely, Kassandra made no comment on this disturbing discovery.",

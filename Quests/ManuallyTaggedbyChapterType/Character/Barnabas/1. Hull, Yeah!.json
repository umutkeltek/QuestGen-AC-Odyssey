Where in Poseidon's name are we going to get the supplies?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''My father told me that the sea takes... and we must do the same. Fortunately there are plenty of pirate ships in these waters that we can board and take from!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are we waiting for? Let's hunt some pirates.''\nKassandra gathered the resourced needed to upgrade the ship's hull.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Now that we have the necessary resources, we can upgrade the ship's hull.''\nKassandra had the ship's hull upgraded.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Poseidon be praised! She's in ramming shape now. Like a fist in the ocean.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra and the crew of the ''Adrestia'' engaged pirates in naval combat, boarded their ships and looted their resources.",

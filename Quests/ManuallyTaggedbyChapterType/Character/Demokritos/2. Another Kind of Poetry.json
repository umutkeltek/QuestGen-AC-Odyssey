My theory\u2014that all atoms exist with a great void between them\u2014s a bit like the life I've lived.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But not anymore. Now you're filling that void.''\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''Maybe... maybe what fills the void, and what draws us together, is love.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Save that\u00a0line for the poet, Demokritos. It's a good one.''\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''You think so? All right, I will!''\n\nArriving at the poet's house, Demokritos was horrified to find [[bandit]]s killing her.\n\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''No! That's her! Those bandits... Stop them!''\n\nKassandra swiftly dealt with the bandits.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Demokritos... I'm sorry.''\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''They killed her. For it to end like this... after all this time.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Read her your \"poem.\"=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have your theorem, and the others... read them to her. Let her see your poetry.''\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''It's too late.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's never too late.''\n|-|We should go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone's going to find us here and think we did this. Demokritos... we have to go.''\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''I... I left once before, I won't leave again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Demokritos, please.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''You can go. In another life... she might've known my love for her. You might have been my student. Imagine the happiness we'd have known.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A wise man told me, \"The richest person in any land is the one who wants for the least.\" Don't want for the past, Demokritos.''\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''I'll leave soon enough. But for now, I think I want for privacy. Take [[Inventor's Helmet|this]], and leave me to mourn, Kassandra.''\n\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to Demokritos once more.\n\n*'''Demokritos:''' ''There is no force in the universe greater than that which binds two people together.''",

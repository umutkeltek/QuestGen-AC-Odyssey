    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra visited a small [[Temple of Artemis, Phokis|Temple of Artemis]] on a small hill. She found a woman outside the temple. The woman spotted Kassandra.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''You! What are you doing here?''\nKassandra approached the woman.\n*'''Daphnae''' ''This is sacred ground. You should not be here.''\n\nThe woman drew her [[sword]].\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Well? Either leave or tell me what you want. Who are you?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm a mercenary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. I'm not here to start trouble, but if that's what you want, I'll end it.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Your name.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm Kassandra. Some call me the [[Eagle]]-Bearer.''\n|-|I'm a traveler.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I mean no disrespect.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Then answer my questions. Who are you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Some know me as the Eagle Bearer, but my friends call me Kassandra.''\n</tabber>\nThe woman withdrew her sword.\n*'''Daphnae''' ''I am Daphnae, leader of the Daughters of Artemis, and you are maybe exactly who I've been looking for.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And who would that be?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''A warrior, a [[Hunting|hunter]]. One who straddles our world and the [[Greek mythology|gods]]'. One who will meet my challenge.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When you put it like that, how could I not accept?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''There is a [[Wild boar|boar]] not too far from here. Kill it, then bring me its pelt.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to kill a [[pig]]?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''This is no ordinary boar. Let's see if you're worthy of my challenge. Kill it, and bring me the pelt. I'm be waiting... with your reward.''\n[[File:ACOD Kalydonian Boar.jpg|thumb|250px|The Kalydonian Boar at its lair]]\nKassandra travelled to the [[Sacred Lands of Apollo|northwest]] region of Phokis. With [[Ikaros]]' help, she spotted the [[Kalydonian Boar]] on a marshy plateau.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a big pig.''\nKassandra defeated the Kalydonian Boar and recovered its pelt.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should get this pelt back to Daphnae at the temple.''\nShe returned to Daphnae.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Did you get lost?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, I killed your piggy for you.''\nKassandra handed the pelt to Daphnae.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Hmm. You are skilled, of that there is no doubt.''\n<tabber>\n|-|There was never a doubt.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You shouldn't doubt my abilities.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Lesson learned. But I'm also interested in seeing what else you can do.''\n|-|Thank you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have plenty of talents, of that you can be sure.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Oh, is that so? Well, I look forward to putting them all to the test.''\nDaphnae went closer to Kassandra.\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh? And what do you have in mind?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Many things... But first, to business. There are beasts that roam this world, but are not fully of it. They've placed here by the gods as trials\u2014as tests.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Fables don't concern me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These beasts are creatures, like any other. The world is full of mysteries, but not everything is unexplained by the gods.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Perhaps before this is over, you will have a different opinion.''\n|-|My path is already legendary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Neither god nor mortal has stopped me so far from achieving my destiny.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''We will see.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What exactly do you want me to do?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''I want you to prove your worth in the eyes of Artemis, and hunt these creatures.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need to prove my worth to anyone. Just tell me what's the reward?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''With each pelt you return, I will grant you a boon from Artemis. If you are able to slay all the beasts\u2014well, let's say your relationship with the Daughters of Artemis will be forever changed...''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Daughters_of_Artemis_-_Kassandra_Accepts_Request.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra accepting Daphnae's request]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll do it. Now, just how many of these animals are there?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Artemis has laid out eight trials, and you already started the journey. Hunt down those that remain.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How will I recognize the creatures?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Oh, you'll know. Bring the pelts to me. I'll await your return with my sisters, the Daughters of Artemis. I hope you don't make me wait to long to see your face again...''",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached the clearing in Elis where the Erymanthian Boar had set up its den. [[Ikaros]] spotted it from on high.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By [[Zeus]]! What's with the size of the boars in this country?''\nKassandra engaged the boar and found its size to not be its only threat. Its noxious gas proved equivalent to a cloud of [[poison]], making it very difficult for her to engage the beast directly. As the battle dragged on, the clouds lingered and the beast only added to them, greatly limiting the non-toxic fighting space.  After a time, she slew the boar and collected its pelt.\n\nKassandra returned to Daphnae to deliver the pelt.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Beast Slayer, I'm glad to see you again.''\n(\"I have the Erymanthian Boar pelt.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This boar was far harder to kill than the [[Kalydonian Boar|Kalydonian one]], but I've yet to meet a pig that can't be skewered.''\nKassandra handed the pelt over to Daphnae.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''The gods chose well when they sent you to me.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I chose my own path.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The gods may watch me, but they do not guide me.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Then I feel for you. Artemis has always steered me right, and that includes in meeting you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Chance can easily be blamed on the gods.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''But can destiny?''\nKassandra blew air through the side of her lips derisively.\n|-|Flirt \u2013 The gods did choose well.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I follow where the gods lead, and they led me to you.''\nDaphnae chuckled.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''They have a sense of humor.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How so?''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''We will talk of the gods and their wishes once the hunt is done.''\n</tabber>\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll return soon.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll return when I have more pelts.''",

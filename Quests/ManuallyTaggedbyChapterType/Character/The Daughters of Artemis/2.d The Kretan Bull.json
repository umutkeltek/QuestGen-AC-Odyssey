Father of the [[Minotaur]].''\nKassandra engaged the bull in combat and dodged its charges. As the battle dragged on, the bull seemed to leverage its front legs and horns to flail its entire body weight in successive strikes at Kassandra, but she eventually defeated it.  She collected its pelt.\n\nKassandra returned to Daphnae to deliver the pelt.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Beast Slayer, I'm glad to see you again.''\n(\"I have the Kretan Bull pelt.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The bull put up quite a fight, but his pelt is yours.''\nKassandra handed the pelt over to Daphnae.\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''You are remarkable!''\n<tabber>\n|-|I am skilled.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Years of training made me a warrior. Life as a ''misthios'' has honed those abilities.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Then at the least you should applaud yourself for your dedication to your... ''art.\n|-|It was a worthy opponent.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No more than the bull. The gods have blessed us with a world of wonder, and we should honor it.''\n*'''Daphnae:''' ''Spoken like a true Daughter of Artemis.''\n</tabber>\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll return soon.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll return when I have more pelts.''",

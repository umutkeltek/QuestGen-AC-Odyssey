    "Section_Dialogue": "While exploring [[Odysseus' Palace]], Kassandra came across a woman held in a cage.\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Hey, get me out of here!''\nKassandra killed the surrounding [[bandit]]s and freed Odessa.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's get out of here. Can you fight?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I'd be happy to.''\nKassandra escorted Odessa out of the palace ruins to safety.\n*'''Odessa:''' ''My thanks. I can't believe I let those'' mal\u00e1kes ''sneak up on me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Ithaka]] is a dangerous place to wander around on your own.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''You're wandering around on your own.''\nOdessa turned and walked a few steps forward before stopping. She sighed.\n*'''Odessa:''' ''You're right. I can't fight a camp of bandits by myself. Could you help me get to Odysseus' palace? I can pay.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you get to the palace.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Well, I'm in luck then. What do I call you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I'm Odessa. Named after the great Odysseus.''\n(If \"Why do you want to go to the palace?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would you want to go up there?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I'm a descendant of Odysseus. I'm on a pilgrimage.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a descendant of the former king of Ithaka?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''And the man who created the [[Trojan Horse]] and defeated the [[Cyclops]] The one who traveled to the land of the {{Wiki|Lotus-Eaters}}. The one the [[Odyssey]] is about? Yes. I am. Why?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not the first who's said that, is all.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Well, I trust I don't need to prove my lineage to get up to the palace.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"Let's go.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should head to the palace while we have the chance.''\nKassandra followed Odessa as they made their way to the palace ruins. They reached a small room.\n*'''Odessa:''' ''This... is it? It's just rubble.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What were you expecting?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I don't know. Something more grand. My parents name me Odessa... I'm Odysseus' namesake. I thought if I came here I might... understand him more.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, do you?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Not at all... Take me to my boat. I'll pay you there.''\nKassandra escorted Odessa to her boat near the southeastern shore.\n[[File:ACOD - A Small Odyssey 2.png|thumb|240px]]\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Well, this is for you. Such a disappointment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why is that place so important for you?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Are you joking? Odysseus lived there. Ruled there. He ended the [[Trojan War]]. Eluded [[Skylla]] and [[Charybdis]]. He had everything. Loyalty. Love. Fighting spirit!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He had the attention of the [[Greek mythology|gods]], too. That caused him a lot of trouble.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''And it made him a legend.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Grow up.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You aren't a child. Stop acting like one.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Wanting what Odysseus had without trying would be childish. I'm willing to do whatever is necessary.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's easier said than done.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Greatness is what I seek. It's what I've desired my entire life. I refuse to end up like everyone around me, content to go about their daily lives until they're forgotten in death.''\n|-|You'll get there one day.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you keep trying, you'll get there. Giving up guarantees you never will.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''You're the first one to encourage me like that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just know it's your decision to make.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Greatness is what I seek. It's what I've desired my entire life. I refuse to end up like everyone around me, content to go about their daily lives until they're forgotten in death.''\n|-|\u2764 It's cute that you're determined.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You look cute right now. As if nothing can get in your way.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I don't usually like being called cute.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI could use a different word.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There are a few other ones I can think of that would suit you.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I can't wait to hear them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How about beautiful? That works even better. The other ones will come later.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I hope \"later\" comes soon.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou'll learn to.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''In time you'll learn to love all the things I have to tell you.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''You seem so certain.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've had lots of success in the past.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I'm sure you have.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nOK, you're ugly.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, you're ugly then.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''That's... not what I meant at all. I can't tell if you're serious or not.''\n}}\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So what do you think?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I think I was a much poorer mood before now. There's just so much I desire. To be as great as Odysseus... Where do I even begin?''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|Great is as great does.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you want Odysseus' greatness, you have to do it your own way. He was famous because of his cunning. What have you done?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I've traveled all the way here!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To see the ruins of Odysseus' life. Not to live your own.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I should have known better than to take advice from a [[mercenary]]. Leave me.''\n|-|Being great isn't easy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Odysseus didn't want to go to war. And once it was over, it took him ten years to get home. He wasted years of his life, all because gods interfered. Stay [[Odessa's Estate|home]]. Spend time with your family. Live your own life.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''But who will remember my story then?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Would you rather be remembered? Or happy?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Hmm. I'll have to give that some thought. Thank you.''\n|-|I don't give advice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It seems like you're looking for advice. I have none to give.''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''No surprise there. Well, thanks for the help.''\n</tabber>\nOdessa left.",

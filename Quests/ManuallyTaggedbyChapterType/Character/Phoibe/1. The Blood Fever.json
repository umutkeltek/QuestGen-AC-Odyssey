    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached Phoibe, who was sitting on a rock.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''How'd it go with Markos?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How it always goes. I didn't get the money, and I'm running another errand for him.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Why do you let him boss you around?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I owe him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I owe him a debt. From the past.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Oh. Did you borrow [[drachmae]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not that kind of debt. Few people would take in a runaway they caught [[Thief|thieving]]. I was just a kid.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Huh. I'm just a kid. And I've done pretty good myself.''\n|-|He doesn't boss me around.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He doesn't. He just gets me into situations I have to dig myself out of.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Maybe you shouldn't let him do that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thanks for the advice.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You're welcome!''\n</tabber>\nKassandra stood up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you want, Phoibe?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You know [[Village of Kausos|Kausos]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The town on the other side of the island? Why?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''People there are sick\u2014and my friend [[Kynna]] is too. There's a blood fever. They say it's a curse and that they need help from the gods.''\n[[File:ACOD The Blood Fever - Kassandra Accept Phoibe's Request.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra accepted Phoibe's request]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I told you. I'm not a god.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''But, [[Ikaros]]\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is a [[Eagle|bird]].''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''That doesn't mean you can't help!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll look into it.''\nKassandra travelled to the village of Kausos, which had been largely burned down.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By the gods. What's happened here?''\n[[File:ACOD The Blood Fever - Kynna's Family.png|thumb|250px|Kynna's family tied up]]\nHe came across a priest and his guards surrounding a family.\n*'''Priest:''' ''Take them away!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''You're murderers! Murderers!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''If the gods won't help you, the sickness must be destroyed by our hands! We have no choice.''\nKassandra approached the priest and the tied up villagers.\n*'''Child:''' ''Help us!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''He won't let us go!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's going on?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Kausos was consumed by plague... We couldn't keep up with the bodies. It was spreading\u2014we had to intervene.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''They killed our brothers! Our neighbours!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''We survived the massacre, but he'll kill us now!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''The gods have abandoned us. The sick must join the dead if we are to save the living!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You burned the whole village?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Many nights were lost praying. We had to take action\u2014to scorch the blood fever out of Kausos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is there no hope for a cure?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Nothing has worked. Sacrifice, prayers...''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Healers won't come near us, [[soldier]]s won't let us leave... The gods won't answer our prayers!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But I don't know anything about plague.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''There's nothing you can do.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''No!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''If you intervene, I will be forced to defend the god's wills.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Save us from him! Have pity!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''We aren't even sick! We'll get better!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Nobody gets better! This is the only way all of [[Kephallonia]] will save itself from extermination!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Please!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''We have children! Think of them!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Don't regret stopping here, ''misthios...\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Let these people go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let them go.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''What?!''\nThe villagers ran for safety.\n[[File:ACOD The Blood Fever - Kassandra Demanding.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra demanding the family to be freed]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're no god.''\nThe priest and his guards attacked Kassandra, who defeated and killed them. Kassandra returned to the villagers outside the village. Phoibe came over.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You're a hero!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''That priest came from the [[underworld]]. Some \"man of the gods.\"''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''The real gods sent you. Time to go. We're well enough to travel, but need healing.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Before you go\u2014take my drachmae. It can't pay for what you gave us, but it's all we have.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll take it.=\nKassandra accepted the coin pouch.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It'll do just fine.''\nShe shook the man's hand.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Safe travels.''\nThe family left the place.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Be safe, Kynna!''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nNo, you need your money.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Forget about that. Just travel safely.''\nKassandra shook the man's hand.\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''You're a gift from the gods, Eagle Bearer. I hope they bless you!''\nThe family left the place.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Bye Kynna! Be safe!''\n}}\n|-|I have no say in this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry. I shouldn't be involved in this.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''We don't have to die!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How many others will die if I free you?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''You have blood on your hands!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''You've acted on the gods' behalf. They'll bless you for this!''\nKassandra left the village, allowing the priest to go ahead with the killing. Phoibe confronted Kassandra.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You... you didn't save them? What about Kynna? She's my friend!''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThey weren't mine to save.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How could I make that choice? I can't always go into things [[spear]] first.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You saw they were in trouble! What about Kynna?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They could infect the entire island, Phoibe. You don't know best either.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nIt's complicated.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's not that simple. You don't understand.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''How do you know? I know you didn't help anyone!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There was no right decision to make. Nobody wins.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI'm sorry about your friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you're sad about Kynna\u2014it's a big loss. But look around you. You want it to be like this everywhere?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''No... But maybe Kynna would get better. They could be wrong about her!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And maybe the sickness would take the family tomorrow. It's impossible to tell.''\n}}\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I hope you're right.''\nKassandra squat down to comfort Phoibe.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sometimes, good people die, Phoibe. No matter how much we don't like it.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I know... I just wish it wasn't true.''\nPhoibe walked away.\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped Phoibe to look into the blood fever plaguing the village of her friend. She was left to decide the family's fate.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "The choices made in this memory will affect the dialogue later in the game. If Kassandra chooses to attack the priest and save the family, she will later be informed by [[Barnabas]] that the blood fever has spread throughout the island, turning it into a graveyard. Phoibe will tell Kassandra upon [[Perikles's Symposium|meeting her]] anew in [[Athens]] that she heard there\u2019s a plague in Kephallonia. Not interfering with the priest's plans to kill the family will leave the young parents and their children dead, but save Kephallonia. It is also possible to skip this mission during Chapter 1, in which case the plague will eventually spread across the island.\n\nThe priest and his two temple guards have unique avatars when viewed by Ikaros. They can be knocked out and recruited as lieutenants for the [[Adrestia]] after the option to knock out is unlocked in [[Equal Employment Opportunity Program]].",

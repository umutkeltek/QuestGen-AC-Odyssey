[[Soldier|Guards]]!''\n[[File:ACOD Legend No More 4.png|thumb|250px|Cult of Kosmos scions confronting the champions]]\nTwo scions of the Cult of Kosmos ran forward to join Drakios. They attacked Kassandra, but Roxana stood with her. The two women fought side by side against the crooked organizer of the Battle of One Hundred Hands, slaying him and all of his men. Kassandra approached Roxana after the battle.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Thank you, champion.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, I'll see you at my [[ship]]?''\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Yes.

Steeling herself from the pain, she looked Kassandra in the eyes and responded. \n*'''Roxana:''' ''So be it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When this is over, I will make an offering to [[Minerva|Athena]] in your honor.''\n[[File:ACOd-LegendNoMore-altKassRoxDrak.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra clashing with Roxana]]\nThe fight began.\n*'''Roxana:''' ''Come on!

This is the kind of fight we'll be remembered for.''\nKassandra defeated Roxana and killed her, then claimed [[Trade Goods|Roxana's shield]] as a prize.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take this [[shield]] to the [[Statue of Athena]] in Athens. Farewell, brave warrior.''\nKassandra then\u00a0approached Drakios, who applauded her victory.\n*'''Drakios:''' ''Well done, ''misthios''.

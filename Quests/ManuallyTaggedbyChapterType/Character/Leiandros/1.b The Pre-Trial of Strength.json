    "Section_Dialogue": "In [[Lato]], Kassandra approached a small [[Warrior's Battleground|arena]], wherein the Pre-Trial of Strength took place. All around the stage itself were people lying on the ground, groaning and moaning and complaining.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''HE CANNOT BE BEATEN! He's too strong. Your only logical choice is to purchase the Trial Token from him. Be wise, friend.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''By [[Zeus]], my legs! If only I hadn't tried to fight the Trial Master. I should have paid him. I SHOULD HAVE PAID HIM!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Put down your [[spear]] and grab your [[drachma]]e, challenger - for only honorable bribery can save you from sharing my astoundingly painful fate!''\n*'''Civilian:''' Oh my bones! ''They are EXTREMELY broken. Don't be a fool - please, you must pay to skip this Pre-Trial!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''The pain! The incredible pain! My limbs and organs - crushed. If only I'd paid for the Trial Token. What an incredible, fairly priced deal!''\nKassandra approached the brute exercising on the stage.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' Chaire'', poorly-muscled challenger! You are here to have your feeble frame crushed in my Pre-Trial of Strength, yes?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My \"feeble frame\" might be harder to crush than you think.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''So brave! Pretending you have a chance against a warrior as strong and handsome as me. We may fight for my Token, yes, but maybe you would prefer to remain un-crushed and buy my Token instead? Yes?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 Let's fight.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, we fight.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''Are you sure you would not prefer to spend your shiny drachmae\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' We fight.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''Then let the crushing begin!''\nKassandra and the Trial Master drew their swords.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''You should have bought my Token, yes? Very good price! Now you must pay a ''new'' price... ''DEATH''.<br>I will use your bones to pick your ''other'' bones from my teeth.''\nKassandra defeated the Trial Master.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' UGH''! This isn't what winning feels like...!<br> Crush, crush, crush...''\nKassandra approached him.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''What\u2014what am I feeling? What is this?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The shame of defeat.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' This'' is defeat?''\nKassandra shrugged\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''...Winning is better, yes.<br>The Token of Strength is yours. Have a wonderful day\u2014and please don't hit me again.''\nAs Kassandra prepared to leave, the Pre-Trial Master joined the chorus of the civilians around the stage.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''My favorite bones! You have crushed them to dust INSIDE of my skin. You ARE a champion, yes!''\n\n|-|I'll buy the token. [1500]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no need for unnecessary bloodshed. I'll pay for your Token.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''A wise choice, my spineless friend. May you one day slither out from under from (sic) the metaphoric rock of your cowardice!''\n|-|I don't have time for this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Strength:''' ''I look forward to more of your cowardice, tiny one!''\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra completed the Trial of Strength, obtaining the token in the process.\n\n\n\nCivilian: Uhh... Is it break time yet? I feel like my legs will be actually crushed if I stay here any longer...",

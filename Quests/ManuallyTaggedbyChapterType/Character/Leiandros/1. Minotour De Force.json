    "General_Description": "'''Minotour de Force''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "In the town of [[Lato]], Kassandra's attention was drawn by the exclamations of [[Leiandros]], promising glory, honour and [[drachma]]e to whoever managed to slay the [[Minotaur]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "In Lato, Kassandra spotted a group of townsfolk crowding around Leiandros.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Who among you is afraid?!<br>Who among you is frail or weak?!<br>Who among you... IS STRONG?!<br>Then I say prove yourselves! Come face-to-face with He of the Blood-Soaked Hooves! He of the Entrail-Splattered Horns! You know his name, you know his roar! The Beast, the Myth... THE MINOTAAAAAUR!!!<br>Maximum of three members per Minotaur hunting party; purchase of Minotaur-themed merchandise ''is'' mandatory before proceeding; no legendary warriors, pregnant heroes, or legitimate gods (demi, semi, or otherwise) are eligible to fight the Minotaur; and no pushing\u2014you'll all get a chance at dismemberment.''\nKassandra approached Leiandros.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Ah, a mighty specimen approaches! Are you ready for honor? For glory?!'' For certain death?!\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready for two-thirds of that.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Then you seek combat with... THE MINOTAUR!''\n<tabber>\n|-|If players already defeated the Minotaur=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Minotaur's already dead, by my hand.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''You killed the Minotaur?!''\nThe man laughed.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I'm sorry my friend, you're very mistaken! Some scam artist fooled you with flame-lit corridors and flimsy costumes! The 100% genuine and completely real Minotaur lives here! And, uh, you better believe it!''\n|-|If players have not defeated the Minotaur=\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThere's no Minotaur here.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No self-respecting Minotaur would live in Lato.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''He does.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Yes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''... In Lato?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Yes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This Lato?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I assure you, the beast lives here, and he wants nothing more than a wealthy - uh, a worthy opponent to battle.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI'm interested=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't see any labyrinths or golden balls of string... but, if there's a Minotaur to be fought, I'm listening.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Then listen well, my observant friend!''\n}}\n</tabber>\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''If you slay the Minotaur, you would be [[Theseus]] reborn!<br>And you'd get to take home the ''Prize of [[Pephka]]!\n(Accept \u2013 I'll kill your Minotaur.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your Minotaur must die.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Sounds like we have... ''another contender!\nThe crowd cheered as Leiandros sold the scene to them.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''It's time for the Trials of the Minotaur.. Pre-Trials.''\n(If players choose \"\"Pre-Trials\"?!\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''... Did you just say Minotaur ''\"Pre-Trials\"''?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''To face the Minotaur, you must first prove yourself ''worthy'' by completing three heroic trials.<br>We can't let people fresh off of the [[trireme]]s casually stroll to their deaths!<br>Pephka policy.''\n**(If players choose \"What are these \"Pre-Trials\"?)\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''What do these Pre-Trials require me to do, exactly?''\n**'''Leiandros:''' ''There's the Trial of Strength, where you fight the greatest warrior in all of [[Krete]]. The Trial of Accuracy, which only a keen eye can overcome! And the Trial of Endurance, where you must brave...<br>The water!'' \n**'''Kassandra:''' ''One of your Trials is swimming?! That's\u2014this is a scheme to fleece me.''\n**'''Leiandros:''' [[Mercenary|Misthios]]'', I\u2014that's\u2014how could you even think such a thing?<br>You're a terrible person.''\n(If players choose \"What is the \"The Prize of Pephka\"?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What exactly is the \"Prize of Pephka\"?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Why, it's limitless riches of course! Warriors defeated by the Minotaur no longer need their [[drachma]]e, so we collect their coins into a grand prize that only a champion who kills the beast may claim.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your grand prize is drachmae looted from the dead?!''\n*'''Leiandros:''' Misthios'', please believe me, many of those coins go straight to the Lato School for Children Whose Parents Were Tragically Killed By the Minotaur!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n(If players choose \"What exactly is the Minotaur?\") <!--present if the Minotaur already slain-->\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me about your \"Minotaur.\"''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Part man, part beast, all monster. His horns are as sharp as blades, and his blades are as sharp as... horns? Wait, no, I always mess that up\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A vivid portrait. You must have seen him personally.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Many times. And I'll tell you this much\u2014no one's ever returned from where he dwells.''\n(If players choose \"What does the name \"[[Melite]]\" mean to you?\") <!--present if Kythera Island's Cultist-quest chain completed -->\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How would you react if I said the name... \"Melite\"?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Uh, Melite? Well, I\u2014No. I've not heard of them. It's a strange name, one I'd remember.''\n(I'm ready.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do your Trials\u2014''\n*'''Leiandros:''' Pre''-Trials!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\u2014I'll do your ''Pre-Trials'', but then the Minotaur's head is mine.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Fantastic! Don't forget to collect Tokens of Success from the Trial Masters to prove your victories.''\nA [[Kore|woman]] interrupted the conversation, walking to them.\n*'''Kore:''' ''Ugh, another \"champion,\" here to save us all from Pephka's long queues and overpriced Minotaur merchandise.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Ah, may I introduce my wife, Kore! A rare beauty, and so\u2014<br>So loud, in front of my new friend.''\n*'''Kore:''' ''Please, Leiandros\u2014there are more important things than glory.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Glory comes first.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing stands in the way of glory. Statues aren't carved to honor the insignificant.''\n*'''Kore:''' ''And what about my daughter? Is she insignificant, \"hero\"?''\n|-|Family comes first.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not everyone with a [[sword]] seeks glory. Family comes before all else.''\n*'''Kore:''' ''Exactly, ''misthios''. That's what I keep telling this cowardly slime in the shape of my husband.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''..Hey!''\n*'''Kore:''' ''It's\u2014it's our daughter.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your daughter?''\n*'''Kore:''' ''[[Amara]]. She ran off days ago.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I'm sure she's\u2014she's just fine!<br>Don't worry about Amara\u2014not when there's a Minotaur to slay!<br />\"GRR!\" \"Slash-slash!\" Big fight! Lots of blood! Think of the fame, ''misthios''! Think of winning the ''Prize of Pephka!\nLeiandros leaned forward, whispering to Kassandra.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Please trust me, champion\u2014nothing is what it seems in Pepha. Solving one problem may just solve all the others...''\nLeiandros stepped backwards and raised his voice again.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Go, my legendary friend! The Pre-Trials of the Minotaur await!''\nKassandra departed to complete the trials mentioned by Leiandros. In doing so, she collected all the three tokens to prove her success.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all 3 Tokens. Better [[Cashing In On the Cow|meet]] Leiandros at the [[Warrior's Rest]].''",

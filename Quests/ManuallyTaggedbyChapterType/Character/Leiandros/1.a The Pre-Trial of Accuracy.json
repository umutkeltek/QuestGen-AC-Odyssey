    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to the [[Warrior's Archery Range]] in town, hearing the [[Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy|Trial Master]] calling for his sons.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''It's been hours. Where are they? Why'd I have to get mal\u00e1kes boys?! Boys! BOYS! Come home! ... [[Mikon]]?''\nKassandra approached the master.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''What trouble have they gotten into now? Their mother's going to feed me to that damned [[Minotaur]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the Pre-Trial of Accuracy.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''Hmm?<br />Oh! Yes! This is the Pre-Trial of... Accurately... finding my mal\u00e1kes sons!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your sons? This doesn't sound like a Trial.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''Have you tried raising sons? It's perhaps the greatest Trial of all!''\nKassandra shook her head.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''Only by completing the world-famous and totally legitimate Pre-Trial of Accurately Finding My Sons can you proceed and face... the Minotaur!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So if I find your sons and make sure they're safe, you'll give me your Trial Token?''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''You'll get my Token and my eternal gratitude!''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll find your sons.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find your sons and pull them out of whatever trouble they've stumbled into.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''They usually hide in the fields behind me. May I suggest you prepare yourself mentally and physically. This will be your greatest Trial yet, brave warrior!''\n(If players choose \"What can you tell me about your sons?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you want me to find your sons, I'll need to know more about them.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''They're little shits.<br />Wondrous, beautiful\u2014but shits all the same. They won't listen to me, but perhaps they'll listen to you.''\n(If players choose \"Where exactly can I find your sons?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said your sons are likely in the field, but I'll need more to go on.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''They climb on everything\u2014buildings, towers, the crops, oh the crops. They're exactly as tall as my sons, creating the perfect place for them to hide!<br />They never listen when I call for them\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They'll listen to me.''\n(Leave \u2013 I'm ready to go.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry, I'll make sure your sons come home safe.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''You must find all three of them! And hurry, there's only so long my wife will believe they're off praying at the temple.''\nKassandra called for [[Ikaros]] to locate the sons' whereabouts. She found one of them in a small building.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found him.''\nShe found another near a silo.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There he is!''\nShe found the last one hiding in the fields near the silos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see him.''\nKassandra departed the archery range and approached the fields, hearing a child.\n*'''Child 1:''' ''You'll never fiiind meeee...! You're actually getting further away from me. I can't even hear you anymore. Oh no, where did you goooo?!''\nKassandra approached the boy.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go home to your father and do as he says\u2014or I'll tell the Minotaur where you live.''\n*'''Child 1:''' ''But\u2014UGH! I ''HATE'' YOU, [[Mercenary|MISTHIOS]]!!!''\nKassandra headed further down the fields, finding one of the sons on top of a silo's scaffolding.\n*'''Child 2:''' ''Help! Please, help me. I\u2014I'm trapped up here!''\nKassandra climbed up the scaffolding.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're safe. Go home. And listen to your ''pater'' when he calls for you.''\n*'''Child 2:''' ''Yes miss, sorry miss.''\nThe child returned home.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I still need to find the Trial Master's other sons.''\nKassandra headed towards a small building, hearing a cry from within.\n*'''Child 3:''' ''Ouch... My arm!''\nShe discovered the entrance to be blocked by a fence and a number of vases.\n*'''Child 3:''' ''I'm not trapped\u2014you can go away now. I'm not even in here!''\nKassandra broke through the fences and got to the son.\n*'''Child 3:''' ''Everything you broke was really expensive. So my ''pater'' will probably kill you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure. Home. ''NOW.\nThe child returned home.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And that's the last of the sons. Better head back to the Trial Master.''\nKassandra returned to the Trial Master at the archery range. Approaching the place, she saw the boys playing by their father.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''My sons! You've brought them home!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were right, they are little shits.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:''' ''Mm. I can't believe they listened to you.<br />Consider the Trial of Accurately Finding My Sons... COMPLETE!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of all my victories, this is the one I'll be most remembered for.''\n(If players talk to him again.)\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Accuracy:'''\u00a0''My wife's pregnant again. Please be a girl, please be a girl, please be a girl...''",

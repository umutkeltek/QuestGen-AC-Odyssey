You have too much to live for... Only spending a quite affordable amount of [[drachma]]e can save your soul!''\nKassandra approached her.\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''I warn you\u2014pay to pass this Trial, potential champion. The Trial of Endurance has seen more deaths than all the other Trials combined!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Were the others drunk when they jumped?''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''Actually, yes. Very unprofessional of them.<br />Should you survive the Champion's Dive, you'll need to retrieve my Trial Token from a chest in the [[Cave of Wealth|darkest depths]] of the water below.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 I'll do your Trial.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your Token will be mine.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''No, please, I urge you\u2014''pay me'' for my Token. The watery dangers you must otherwise face to retrieve it are too great!''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll do the Trial.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You won't get one drachma from me. I'll do the Trial.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''If an excruciating underwater death is what you desire, who am I to stop you? Remember, you'll find my Token in a chest at the bottom of the lake.<br />I'll be waiting for you at the water's edge in the extremely unlikely event you survive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How exactly does going for a swim test my ability to slay the [[Minotaur]]?''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''...Minotaurs work in mysterious ways?''\nThe trial master walked away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Seems like a lot of hassle for a Token...''\nKassandra approached the edge of the platform and spotted several [[Great white shark|sharks]] in the waters below.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like I'll have to get wet.''\nKassandra dove into the waters below and eliminated the sharks. After doing so, she dove further towards a cave, wherein she found a chest and looted its contents, including the token.\n|-|I'll pay. [1500]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just give me the mal\u00e1kas Token.''\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''Some might say you've paid to skip, others may call you an honorless coward... But know this: today you've invested in not dying. Excellent choice, champion.''\n</tabber>\n\n(If players talk to her again after the mission.)\n*'''Pre-Trial Master of Endurance:''' ''Don't lose your Token, champion! But if you do, I can give you a'' fantastic ''deal on a replacement.''",

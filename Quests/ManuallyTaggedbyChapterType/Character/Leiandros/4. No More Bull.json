    "General_Description": "'''No More Bull''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Though she discovered the Minotaur to be nothing but [[Leiandros]] in an ill-fitting, poorly-made [[Minotaur Helm|mask]], Kassandra agreed to save [[Amara|his daughter]], who'd been kidnapped by [[Cult of Kosmos|the Cult]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra followed Leiandros up the ladder leading out the back of the [[Cave of the Brave]].\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''These Masked Men, they're organized and unafraid. Their greatest weapon is no blade; ''it's our greed.<br />''Every [[merchant]], every man and his [[Slavery|slave]] earn enough [[drachma]]e out of this charade to make [[Midas (mythology)|Midas]] blush. The myth of the Minotaur makes us all rich... and we turn a blind eye to the cost.''\nAs they continued through the cave, his costume began to chafe.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Gah, why is this suit chafing?! I used a whole bottle of olive oil...!<br />Hard... to breathe... in a costume... this magnificent...<br />By [[Zeus]], this fur doesn't breathe ''at all!\nThey exited the cave, and Leiandros tried to vivify himself.\n*'''Leiandros:''' You'' are the Minotaur. You ''are'' the Minotaur. You are the ''Minotaur! ''You are ''the'' Minotaur. No, no, the last one was better. I'm coming, Amara! Do not be afraid! And don't you be afraid, Leiandros. She needs you.''\nIn time, Kassandra caught up to him outside [[Zakros]], where Amara was held.\n*'''Leiandros:''' Misthios'', over here! It's me, Leiandros, the friendly Minotaur in the bushes!<br />Don't be afraid, it's not the real Minotaur\u2014it's only me, Leiandros!''\nKassandra spoke to him.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''You came! I was sure I'd fight alone.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll stand with you, Leiandros. No matter what happens today, Amara will be proud of her fath\u2014''\nShe stopped herself when she noticed he was still wearing the Minotaur mask.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see you're still a Minotaur.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I've faced many of the [[Greece|Greek]] world's deadliest warriors in this mask.<br />Granted, I was just there to distract those warriors with my roars and threatening gestures so they could be ambushed and stabbed from behind.<br />But... wearing it makes me feel brave.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You look brave.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you look it. It would be an honor to fight alongside the mythical Minotaur.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Yes! YES!'' MOOOO!\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't do that.''\n|-|You look ridiculous.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You look like the one thing [[Alkibiades]] wouldn't take to bed ...Can you even see out of that thing?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Mock all you want. When those mal\u00e1kes in Zakros see this beast charging towards them, they will know fear!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''They must be keeping her underground. With hooves and heroics, we shall save her.<br />But Zakros is well-defended. How should we proceed?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 We use a stealthy approach.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Quietly. I'll try to sneak in. Stay back here until it's safe.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I can be stealthy!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have horns.''\nLeiandros sighed.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Go, I'll do my best to distract the [[guard]]s.''\nLeiandros ran off as they set the stealth plan into motion.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Where is your honor, you masked ''mal\u00e1kes''?!<br>The Minotaur calls you! Come and face me! Show me your bravery...<br>By leaving the safety of your fortress and coming out into the open!''\nKassandra infiltrated the ruins of Zakros while Leiandros begun his distraction.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Rooooooooooar!!!<br>Look at me! Over here, everyone! It's the Minotaur! And he's\u2014he's so angry, right now, at you?<br>Mooooooo!!!<br>Face me!''\nWhile Leiandros had them distracted, she dispatched the bandits in her path and \n|-|Accept \u2013 We charge!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We charge!''\nKassandra and Leiandros charged into the ruins, clashing with the bandits inside.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Mortals, you are no match for... the Minotaur!<br />Not even [[Theseus]] could kill me! Bleed, mortals!<br />Your injustice will be trampled! Bring me your delicious human flesh! Hmm. Perhaps I'm getting just a little too into character...<br />Roooooooooooar!!!<br />Mooooooo''\nKassandra and Leiandros defeated the bandits.\n</tabber>\nKassandra then made her way to the caves beneath the ruins, where she spotted Amara and another civilian in cages.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found her!''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I didn't do anything. Let me go! Please... please...! Their masks... Their masks...''\n*'''Amara:''' ''No, please\u2014I've been quiet! I haven't cried! I\u2014I can be silent... Don't hurt me...<br />Please, find my father! Find Leiandros!''\nKassandra released them both. The civilian ran off while Amara stuck close to her savior.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Take cover! I'll find you when I know it's safe.''\n*'''Amara:''' ''Thank you, thank you, thank you!''\nKassandra escorted Amara out of the ruins.\n*'''Amara:''' ''You saved me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well\u2014''\nLeiandros approached them wearing the mask. Amara gasped.\n*'''Amara:''' ''Is that the Minotaur?!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Lie \u2013 That really is the Minotaur.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, that... absolutely is the real, authentic Minotaur.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''It's all right, Amara. No one will ever hurt you again, not while I\u2014''the Mighty Minotaur''\u2014am here to protect you.''\nAmara however was able to see through Leiandros' guise.\n*'''Amara:''' ...Pater''?! You think I don't know your voice?!''\nLeiandros took off his mask.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''... Hi honey.''\nAmara smiled.\n*'''Amara:''' ''I think you make a handsome Minotaur.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I know, darling. I know.''\n|-|That is your father.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Show her.''\nLeiandros removed his mask and smiled at his daughter.\n*'''Amara:''' ''...Father...? ''You're'' the Minotaur?!''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Maybe don't tell your mother.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Amara:''' ''I waited and waited and\u2014you weren't going to leave me here, were you? You were just working on your plan to save me, right ''pater''?''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Of course. I was always coming for you, I just... needed to find something first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people who took you... If there's anything you overheard, anything that could help me stop them\u2014''\n*'''Amara:''' ''While I pretended to sleep, their [[Melite|leader]] spoke of a [[Kresilas' Residence|meeting place]] in [[Kydonia]]. I wrote down all the Masked Men's whisperings. Hopefully something in here will be useful to you.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''My ''friend'', we're heading to my [[Kore|wife]]. She keeps a vigil for Amara at the [[Warrior's Rest]]. Come with us. See the gift you gave\u2014our family, together.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''After you.''\nKassandra followed them back to Warrior's Rest, where Kore was waiting. At the sight of her, Amara ran to her.\n*'''Kore:''' ''Amara, ''Amara''! You're alive!''\n*'''Amara:''' Mater''!''\nKassandra and Leiandros drew closer.\n*'''Kore:''' ''My family...''\nShe looked at Kassandra.\n*'''Kore:''' ''You did this?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Leiandros helped.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank Leiandros. When the time came for action, he charged, despite being outskilled and... out-costumed. He fought courageously. Your husband is no coward.''\nKore smiled and looked at Leiandros.\n*'''Kore:''' ''Perhaps there ''are'' some heroes here.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''No one's ever won the [[Prize of Pephka]]! Everyone who's died facing the \"Minotaur\" has had their drachmae go in the vault, growing year by year. And now... a ''tiny'', but well earned, portion of it is yours!''\nKassandra started to thank him, until she realized how little she was getting.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you for ''a tiny portion?!\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Of course! Less taxes, reasonable operational expenses and\u2014''\nKassandra lunged at him.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I'll make sure ''all'' of it reaches your [[Adrestia|boat]], ''misthios''! You've earned it! Haha!<br>Oh, and\u2014this is for you.''\nHe handed her his mask.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''A coward doesn't deserve to be the Minotaur. You do.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Quite the compliment.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 I alone saved Amara.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No thanks to that coward you call a husband.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''No! That's not - I -''\n*'''Kore:''' Quiet. ''Give the true hero the reward she deserves.''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Yes, of-of course, my love!''\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''No one's ever won the [[Prize of Pephka]]! Everyone who's died facing the \"Minotaur\" has had their drachmae go in the vault, growing year by year. And now... a ''tiny'', but well earned, portion of it is yours!''\nKassandra started to thank him, until she realized how little she was getting.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you for ''a tiny portion?!\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''Of course! Less taxes, reasonable operational expenses and\u2014''\nKassandra lunged at him.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''I'll make sure ''all'' of it reaches your [[Adrestia|boat]], ''misthios''! You've earned it! Haha!<br>Oh, and\u2014this is for you.''\nHe handed her his mask.\n*'''Leiandros:''' ''No more masks.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kore:''' ''Pephka is no longer safe for us. Freeing Amara will bring repercussions from people who are not known to be forgiving. But we're alive, and whatever future we have\u2014we have it only because of you.''\nKassandra patted Kore on the shoulder.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Be safe.''\nKore took her leave and joined her husband and daughter, off to whatever future awaited them. Kassandra headed off to find and kill [[Melite]], leader of the Cultists in Pephka.\n(If players talk to the family after the mission.)\n*'''Kore:''' ''You saved my family, Misthios, you are someone I'll never forget.''\n*'''Amara:''' ''Maybe one day I'll be just like you...''\n*'''Leiandros:'''\u00a0''You were right, I needed to be brave. I needed to stand. And look at the reward - my family, safe. Thank you for all you've done. We sail for safer shores. I hope we never, ever,\u00a0ever, ever, eeeeeever see each other again.''\nKassandra laughs.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Goodbye, Minotaur.''",

    "Section_Trivia": "*The name of this quest has a double meaning. \"No more bull\" references the fact that Leiandros stops playing the Minotaur, but is also short for \"no more bullshit\", which also references Leiandros' role as Minotaur.",

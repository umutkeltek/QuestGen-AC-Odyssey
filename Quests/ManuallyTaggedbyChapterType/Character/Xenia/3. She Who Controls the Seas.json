    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached Xenia.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''So, my West Wind returns.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It seems I've picked up your taste for treasure hunting.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Is there no greater passion?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, what do you have for me?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''A group of [[bandit]]s has put their hands on [[Triton]]'s conch shell. They think it has the power to control the tides. Many would want such a thing. Will you bring it to me?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I will get the treasure.=\nXenia gives her three maps of the rumored locations of the bandits' lair, and Kassandra receives them agonizingly.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''More maps?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''How else would you find the bandits? Go on now, I want that shell.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From your lips to the gods' ears, it will be in your possession.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''It is your work that gives me riches, not theirs.''\n|-|No, not right now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm in the middle of something.''\nKassandra returns.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''The West Wind! Are you here to retrieve Triton's conch shell for me?''\n(Back to dialogue choice one.)\n</tabber>\n(If players choose \"What's so special about this shell?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like quite the story. Is the shell at least made of gold?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''My friend, in our time together... Would you think I'd be interested in such an object if it were not made of gold?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you sure you're not trying to control the tides?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Only fools think they can move the sea.''\n(If players choose \"Who are these bandits?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know anything about the bandits that have it?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''They're bandits. They steal and kill. What more is there to know?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm. I could easily describe you and your pirates the same way.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''You want to know how we differ? Take a look around you. I have an island. Them? They have a hole in the ground.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n(Leave - \"I'll go find that shell.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back with your shell.''\nHaving recovered the shell, Kassandra returned to Xenia.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have what you need.''\nXenia held out a hand open.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Give it here then.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|For you, my friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One shell, delivered safe and sound to the Queen of the Sea.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Your services are appreciated.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let me know if you need anything else.''\n|-|This'll cost you extra.=\nKassandra reaches from her pocket and hands her the shell.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any trip that involves me diving into an underwater cave doubles the cost.''\nXenia smiles.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''I'm not sure what the better addition to my collection is, this shell, or the one holding it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's always a pleasure to have your [[drachma]]e jingling in my pouch, Xenia.''\n</tabber>",

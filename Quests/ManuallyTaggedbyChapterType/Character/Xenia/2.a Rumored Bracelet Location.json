    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra sailed to one of the five rumored locations and looted the place.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not bad! But I don't think this is what Xenia is looking for.''\nShe finally arrived at the [[Sanctuary of Sounion]] and went behind it down an altar by a cliff. She noticed something different.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Huh. An offering box is missing.''\nKassandra investigated a trail of clues.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These ribbons tied the box shut.<br>The lid of the offering box.<br>Flower petals. These would have lined the offering box.<br>Someone tossed the box here... but it's empty.''\nAs she turns round a corner, she saw two men arguing and overhears them.\n*'''Laios:''' ''Didn't you like it? I thought you would like it!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Perhaps one of these couples saw something.''\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''Doesn't matter if I liked it. You stole from the gods!''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Laios:''' ''Do you have any idea how much it was worth?''\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''What it's worth? What's a curse from the gods worth?!''\n*'''Laios:''' ''Don't be a superstitious donkey! That bracelet was priceless!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hey.''\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''All you care about is [[drachma|money]]! What about how I feel?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hey!''\n*'''Laios:''' ''I wanted to impress you!''\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''You wanted to get into my clothes, you mean!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''HEY!''\nThey finally turned their attention to her.\n*'''Laios:''' ''Huh? What do you want?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me who stole the bracelet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Which one of you idiots stole the bracelet from the shine?''\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''By [[Poseidon]], she knows!''\n*'''Laios:''' ''Shut your teeth! She doesn't know anything! How could she?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe because every [[goat]]-herder around could hear your spat? Give me the bracelet.''\n*'''Laios:''' ''You don't scare me!''\nKassandra stepped closer to him, angry.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where?''\n|-|I was sent by Apollo to punish you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tremble, you fools, for I am the wrath of [[Apollo]]!''\nKassandra moved her arms dramatically.\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''I told you Laios! The gods come to punish us!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Exactly! Give me what I want or I will smite you down!''\nNervous, Laios looked at.\n*'''Laios:''' ''And what do you want?''\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''Fool! She wants the bracelet you stole!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You understand completely! Give me the bracelet!''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Hyacinthos:''' ''I threw it off the cliffs, into the sea.''\nKassandra whispered to herself.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka. ''Guess I'm going for a swim.''\n\nKassandra walked a few paces to the cliff's edge and dove. She found the Makedonian Bracelet on the seafloor.",

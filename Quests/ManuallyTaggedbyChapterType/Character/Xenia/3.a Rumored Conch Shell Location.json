    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra finally arrives to the correct rumored location at the [[Underwater Cavern]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm. The entrance must be underwater.''\nShe dove and dealt with a shark swimming around the entrance, then swam through it. She swam through a long, winding tunnel lighted only by bioluminescent jellyfishes, then surfaces to a small chamber before continuing to the next submerged, and twisting tunnel. Kassandra finally arrives to the main cave and kills all the bandits before looting the chest in the middle.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, this is the conch? It's heavy. I can see why Xenia wants it.''\nAfter examining the conch, Kassandra looks around.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd rather not swim through that tunnel again. There's a breeze in here. Must be another way out.''\nShe saw the ladders going up to the surface entrance of the cavern and climbed it.",

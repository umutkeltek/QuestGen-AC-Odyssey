    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra reached the location marked on one of the three maps and looted the chest.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm. This is very nice... but I don't think it's what Xenia is looking for.''\nShe sailed to another rumored location and looted the area.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This doesn't seem to be what Xenia's looking for... but it'll fill my purse nicely.''\nAfter Kassandra arrived and docked on [[Isle of Salamis]] and found the [[Lighthouse of the Father of Ajax]] on the isle's southern tip.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gods be good, I think this is the right spot.''\nKassandra noticed a ''pithos'' beside the beacon and looked inside it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm. Empty. Someone else had the same idea.''\nNearby, she found a forlorn [[lighthouse keeper]].\n*'''Lighthouse Keeper:''' ''The gods will abandon us!''\nAs Kassandra addressed the man, he continued his wailing.\n*'''Lighthouse Keeper:''' ''We are doomed! The gods will curse our names!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me what's wrong.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It can't be that bad.''\n*'''Lighthouse Keeper:''' ''Oh, it's terrible!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me what happened.''\n|-|Stop wailing!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stop that noise!''\nThe man was startled.\n*'''Lighthouse Keeper:''' ''Ahh!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Better. Now, quietly, tell me what happened here.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Lighthouse Keeper:''' ''The lighthouse was plundered by bandits, the [[Terrors of Kyknos]]! I fear they've gone to the [[Mycenaean Tomb of Ajax]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll deal with them.''\n*'''Lighthouse Keeper:''' ''Oh, no. There are too many of them!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll try to stop the bandits.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They won't expect anyone to come after them. I'll sneak up and surprise them.''\n|-|I'll crush them like insects.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ajax is not the only one blessed by the gods. I'll crush these so-called terrors!''\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra sought out the tomb and killed the bandits, finding the feather on the leader's corpse.",

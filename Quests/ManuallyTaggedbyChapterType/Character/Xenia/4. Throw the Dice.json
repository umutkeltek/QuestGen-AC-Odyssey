    "General_Description": "'''Throw the Dice''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "When Kassandra found the ardent [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Xenia|queen]] in a rage over the thief [[Autolykos]], she vowed to find the stolen maps and recover the lost treasures.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Xenia:''' ''My West Wind, you have shown a keen nose for hunting treasure. I'm hoping to rely on you now for more personal work.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did you have in mind?''\nXenia turns enraged.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''A crooked merchant stole several of my maps!''\nKassandra sniggers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A dishonest merchant got the better of you?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''His act burns in my breast! The maps pointed to relics that would be crown pieces in my collection. Find them, and I'll shower you with [[drachma]]e.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll look for this merchant.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me what happened.''\n|-|I'm too busy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe another time, Xenia.''\nKassandra returns.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''My favorite little weapon returns. How about tracking down the snivelling merchant who stole from me?''\n(Back to dialogue choice one.)\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Xenia:''' ''The cozener Autolykos is a swindler and a cheat. He robbed me of some of [[Anaximander]]'s best work! I'm sure he's planning to find my treasures and sell them for a fortune.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK, OK! I'll try to find him before he can do that.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''He ruts about [[Nauplia]]. Check there.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what I can uncover.''\nKassandra sails to Nauplia Harbor and saw a bald man in a black ''{{Wiki|Chiton (costume)|chiton}}'' watching over his goods in ''{{Wiki|Pithos|pithoi}}''. She approaches him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've come to talk to you, little man.''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Eh? Who are you? You know what, I don't care. I don't like your look.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's wrong with my look?''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''You smell like you don't have any money.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Actually, I smell like a pirate.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you not like the way I look, or the way I smell? Xenia sent me... but I'm tougher than her crew.''\nThe merchant grows nervous.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Xenia? Uh, she remembers me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh yes, and she's not happy. Return the maps you stole, and I won't have to hurt you.''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Stole?! Is that what she told you? She lost them to me in a bet! You tell her not [to] cast dice and cry over the results.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nGive the maps back, or else.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't care if she lost a bet or dropped them while drunk. She wants her maps, and you're going to give them to me. Now.''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Stuff it in your ass, ''mal\u00e1ka.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have it your way.''\nKassandra proceeds to destroy one of his goods to intimidate him.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''No! No! No more!''\nShe destroys three more and he wails.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Enough! Stop! The maps are in my residence!''\nKassandra raises her voice.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where?''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''It lies next to the [[Nauplia Shipshed]], not far from here.''\nShe threatens him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The maps better be there, or I'll come back for you.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nXenia didn't lose, you cheated her.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You cheated at dice and tricked her into losing. Admit it, or I break something... starting with your hands!''\nThe merchant is surprised.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''How did you know?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could smell it.''\nHe speaks nervously.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''The maps are at my residence, near the Nauplia Shipshed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You better not even think of lying.''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''I'm not, I'm not! I know if I did, you'd just come back to hound me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You. Got. That. Right.''\n}}\n|-|I smell like a god.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you smell the infernal winds of [[Erebus|Erebos]]? Because I will fall upon you like one of the [[Erinyes|Furies]].''\nThe merchant stutters.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Who are you? What have I done?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Return the maps you stole from Xenia, or I'll destroy you like your wares!''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''You wouldn't dare.''\nKassandra proceeds to destroy one of his goods to intimidate him.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''No! No! No more!''\nShe destroys three more and he wails.\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''Enough! Stop! The maps are in my residence!''\nKassandra raises her voice.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where?''\n*'''Autolykos:''' ''It lies next to the [[Nauplia Shipshed]], not far from here.''\nShe threatens him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The maps better be there, or I'll come back for you.''\n</tabber>\n\nRegardless, Kassandra is lead to the shipshed nearby. She manages to loot the chest inside its house.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Aha! Perfect. With these, I can track down the treasures Xenia wants.''\nShe then sets sail to find the relics the two maps points to. After acquiring the relics, which turn out to be instruments allegedly from the gods, Kassandra delivers it to Xenia.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''The tide has brought my favorite little weapon back. What do you have for me?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|First, pay me double.=\nKassandra is annoyed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know how much work I had to do? For a couple of ordinary musical instruments? I could have just gone to the market...''\nXenia turns vexed.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''These are not common instruments. These are fine works of art!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you should pay me double.''\nXenia laughs.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Double?! Mal\u00e1ka... I like the way you think. Done!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you.''\n|-|Here, I hope you like them.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found both treasures! Beautiful works, I'm sure the music they make will be... divine.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Gratitude. Glad they were still there for you to get.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you play?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Sadly not. Still, they'll look good in my chambers. Here, for your trouble.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Now, my West Wind, your timing is sharper than a [[spear]] point. I have a much more serious matter to discuss. Follow.''\n\n(Dialogue continues to the start of the next quest, [[Priceless Treasure]].)",

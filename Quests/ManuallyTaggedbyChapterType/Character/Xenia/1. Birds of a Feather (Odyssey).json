I could use your talents. One like you is always interested in more [[drachma]]e, yes?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm always interested in getting paid.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Always happy to hear the clink of drachmae. Tell me what you want.''\n|-|Payment is fine, but I'm happy to help you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Payment is well and good. But I'm happy to help you. Tell me what you're thinking.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Xenia:''' ''I have an appetite for rare treasures. I've heard many veiled rumors and provocative stories, and I want you to recover some of these lost wonders for me.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll bring you the treasures.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where to look, and I'll bring you these treasures.''\n|-|I'm too busy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't have the patience to go chasing after children's stories.''\nKassandra left, but eventually reconsidered her decision and returned to Xenia.\n*'''Xenia''' ''What tide sweeps you back to me, Kassandra? Are you up for finding my treasures now?''\n(returns to previous option)\n</tabber>\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Have you heard of the mighty [[Ajax]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:\u00a0'''''One of [[Homer]]'s heroes.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Yes! He had a golden [[eagle]] feather, a gift from [[Jupiter|Zeus]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And why do you care about it?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''It is a rare reminder of a glorious age. And so deserves to be in my grasp. Take these maps and see if you can find it.''\n(If \"Where is the feather?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where will I find this golden eagle feather?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Different tales place it at different locations. I have maps showing where you might find it.''\n(If \"What is the story of the feather?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What can you tell me about Ajax's feather?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''The son of [[Telamon]] was said to be a fearless [[giant]]. Some say the golden feather that gave him courage was woven into a [[shield]] crafted of seven [[Cattle|ox]] hides. The shield is long destroyed, but Zeus' feather remains.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll start my search.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find this feather for you, if it's there to be found.''\nSometime later, Kassandra acquired the feather and returned to\u00a0an eager\u00a0Xenia.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''You return on the wind. Do you have Ajax's golden feather for me?''\n<tabber>\n|-|It'll cost you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here. One golden eagle feather, per request.''\n*'''Xenia''' ''What a pretty, pretty thing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Glad you're happy. Now, my pay?''\n*'''Xenia''' ''Calm yourself. Here, for your trouble.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thanks.''\n|-|I'll give you the feather.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, have it.

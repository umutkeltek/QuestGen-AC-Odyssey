He thought it was poisoned.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Nonsense! Who would think such a thing of Markos. Go to him, try again!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not a chance. His bodyguards went after me. He was not happy.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Oh that's not a good thing.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nIf players fought and killed Cerberus. =\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Either way he's dead now.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Dead? That's just great. I guess there's only two left to deal with now.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Two?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''The Cerebrus is three men. Why do you think they're called the Cerberus? Because they're three brothers\u2014triplets!''\n*'''Markos:''' ''What to do, what to do...? What am I saying? Kassandra, this is when we strike.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Strike? You and what army?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''I have a demi-god for a best friend! That's an army as strong as twenty soldiers.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nIf players did not kill Cerberus. =\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, it's not good.

It'll be easy, my friend!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Three?!''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Why do you think they're called the Cerberus? Because they're three brothers\u2014triplets! Each with as much bite as the last.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Great. So there are two others that'll want revenge.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Wait a minute, wait a minute\u2014that means two of them haven't tried my wine!''\n}}\n|-|If players drank the wine=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The wine made us sick, Markos.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Impossible!

As Mama says, a threat is like a bear\u2014very scary! We'll burn the Cerberus' farm. Specifically, the silos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not a good idea.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''When have you had reason not to trust me? Don't answer that, my friend. Just trust me!''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll burn their farm.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It better work... Though I'm skeptical.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''It's even worth sacrificing them as potential customers.''\n(If players choose \"What does the farm grow?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you want the crops burned, too?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''They grow herbs\u2014harmless plants for medicine. It's just the silos that should go. Blow them up!''\n(If players choose \"Who are the Cerberus brothers?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You couldn't have mentioned there were three of them before?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''I thought it was implied. Having triplets runs in their family.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a lot of cerberuses.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Let's hope they don't procreate and have Cerberus puppies.''\n(Leave \u2013 I'll go now.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll pay their farm a visit.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Give them a good scare. I'm pretty sure it's the farm in Astypalia City... Their goons are always hanging around.''\n<tabber>\n|-| If the silos weren't already burned down=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got it.''\nKassandra approached the farm near [[Astypalia City]]. Spotting a silo, she set it on fire\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's one silo down.''\nAs Kassandra approached another silo, she overheard a farmer.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''What the fuck? My silos! Stop!''\nKassandra burned down another silo.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One more silo to go.''\nKassandra approached another silo and similarly burned it down.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Done. I'll tell Markos it made quite the impression.''\n\n|-| If the silos were already burned down=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The farm in Astypalia City? I burned those silos, and I didn't see any Cerberus there.''\n*'''Markos:''' '' What? Their soldiers are always hanging around...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure. There were only scared farmers.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''No dogs and no Cerberus... Maybe it's not their farm after all. We sure dodged that arrow.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It won't stop the Cereberus from coming for you.''\n(Transitions into [[Markos's Fate]])\n</tabber>",

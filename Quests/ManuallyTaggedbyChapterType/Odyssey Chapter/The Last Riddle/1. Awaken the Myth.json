    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra returned to the Lair of the Sphinx.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The statue. It's gone.''\nAs Kassandra approached the plinth where the statue used to sit, she noticed [[Gorgias (historian)|Gorgias]] lying dead nearby. She inserted the medallion, but nothing happened.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It must only work at night. I should come back after dark.''\n[[File:ACOD Awaken the Myth 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the Sphinx]]\nThat night, Kassandra returned. After she'd inserted the medallion, she took a few steps back, waiting. Suddenly, a light beam struck down the plinth like lightning. She looked away for a moment from the flash, but when she looked back, the [[Sphinx]] sat on the plinth. Kassandra looked in awe as the Sphinx relaxed, smiling at her. Curious, she moved a little closer.\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''Another challenger. I hope you're more resilient than the last one.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By the gods! The statue came alive!''\nA snake appeared beside the Sphinx's left leg - its tail.\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''I am no statue, child. If you cannot comprehend what stands before you, how are you to entertain me?''\n(If players choose \"What are you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you?''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''The Sphinx. The guardian of truth and knowledge.''\n(If players choose \"What are you doing here?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why are you here?''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''The [[Isu|gods]] sent me to protect something, and I've been its guardian ever since.''\n(If players choose \"I'm not here to entertain you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I\u2014I came here for another reason.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''Oh? Then tell me, little one. Why are you here?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I've come to destroy you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've come to end you and take your [[Atlantis artifact|power]].''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''Many before you have tried. All have failed.''\nThe Sphinx's snake tail hisses.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''While it would amuse me to see you try, harming me will not give you what you seek. The only way to acquire the power I possess is to impress me with your mind.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds simple enough.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''If you are correct, I will surrender that which I guard. If you are wrong,'' I ''shall end'' you.\n|-|I need your artifact.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You protect an object of great power. I have been asked to return it to where it belongs.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''A most noble of causes. Sadly I cannot grant your request.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's too much at stake. I won't leave without it.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''The power I guard is not for the [[Human|weak-willed]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can [[Hybrid|resist]].''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''One must risk everything in the pursuit of knowledge. If you can answer my questions wisely, you will have proven yourself worthy.''\n</tabber>\n\n(The Sphinx will ask any three riddles from a dozen different riddles.)\n\n<tabber>\n|-|1=\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''What is always old and sometimes new; never sad, sometimes blue; never empty, but sometimes full; never pushes, always pulls?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe moon.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The moon.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''An interesting choice.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThe tide.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The tide.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''How fascinating you are.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThe sky.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The sky.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''That is a bold choice.''\n}}\n|-|2=\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''This thing all things devour: birds, beasts, trees, flowers; gnaws iron, bites steel; grinds hard stones to meal; slays kings, ruins towns; and beats high mountains down.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nArmies.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Armies.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''This is most entertaining.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nTime.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''I'm impressed.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nNature.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nature.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''How fascinating.''\n}}\n|-|3=\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''In spring I am gay in handsome array; in summer more clothing I wear; when colder it grows, I fling off my clothes; and in winter quite naked appear.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nA tree.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a tree.''\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''Impressive, little one.

The players must remember the answers they gave, but not necessarily in sequence.)\n\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''You'' are ''an interesting one. Now, take what you have learned and touch the symbols that reflect your choices.''\n\n(If players touched the wrong symbols.)\n*'''Sphinx:''' ''Like those who came before, you have failed.''\nAll the surrounding symbols glowed intensely to power up the Sphinx's plinth. Kassandra tried to flee, but was shot by a beam of light from the plinth, killing her.\n\n(If players touched the correct symbols.)\n\n[[File:ACOD Awaken the Myth 6.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra beside the deceased Sphinx]]\nKassandra walked back to the plinth to see what would happen next but was momentarily blinded by a flash of light. When the light settled, the Sphinx glowed intensely gold all over except for her agonized face. The Sphinx reached for Kassandra but the glow died along with her. Kassandra stood in astonishment for a little while before squatting down and plucking the large golden feather from the Sphinx's head. The feather glowed brightly as it shook violently in her hands, attempting to transmute her. With her eyes closed from the struggle, she was unaware of a ghostly Sphinx reaching its clawed paw towards her.\n*'''Unknown:''' ''...Outwit our oppressors, hide our truth within lies...''\n[[File:ACOD Awaken the Myth 9.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra holding the relic]]\nKassandra grit her teeth and continued to struggle against the artifact's power. Thanks to her willpower and the [[Tainted One|unique blood]] within her veins, she managed to resist. Subdued, the artifact ceased its attempt and took its [[Prize of the Sphinx|true shape]] in the form of an [[Apples of Eden|apple]]-like sphere, which glowed with the same light, albeit dimmer. Kassandra exhaled and pocketed the artifact before leaving the ruins, not noticing the desiccated human corpse of the artifact's previous holder behind her.",

    "Section_Description": "While hunting for the [[Champions of Boeotia]], especially [[Drakon]], Kassandra met [[Melanippos]], a man desperately in love with Drakon.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to the [[Gymnasium, Thebes|gymnasium]] in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and found a forlorn looking man standing in the center of the building, cursing at himself.\n*'''Melannipos:''' ''You're a fool, Melanippos. A fool.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did you lose your [[pankration]] match?''\n*'''Melannipos:''' ''Worse. I lost my one true love. My Drakon has found someone else\u2014I just know it. he avoids me, and when we're together he's always distracted...''\n<tabber>\nSounds like it's over.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I admit, it doesn't sound good.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Even'' you ''think I've been replaced. But I can't let him go. He's my golden'' demigod.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you must have a plan.''\n|-|Don't lose hope.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe there's still a chance?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''I can't leave this up to the whims of [[Tyche]]. I won't let Drakon go.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then what's your plan?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''I'm going to make a potion. It's a recipe that guarantees eternal love.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's an honest way to save a relationship.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''It's simple. I'll \"borrow\" his precious [[armor]] for a few days, coat the inside, and let the potion seep through his skin\u2014straight to his heart.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So... Drakon will be left without his armor. Aren't you worried he'll be vulnerable?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Oh, he's the strongest, most ''chiseled'' man in Thebes. He'll be fine without it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good to know.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''My problem is the ''last'' ingredient. I need to buy the rarest herb in Boeotia from my herbalist, but she hasn't come to Thebes in a while.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll find the herbalist for you)\n[[File:ACOD Brewing Love 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra agreed to help Melanippos]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can find her for you. I must believe in love after all.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Thank you, thank you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where will I find this herbalist?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''She lives on a [[Herbalist's Farm|farm]] west of the city near the [[Tomb of Menoikeus]].''\n(If players choose \"What is the herb for?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Rare herb, huh? What is it?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''A herb hot enough to ''impassion'' him. Red hot to make his affections\u2014and his skin\u2014sizzle.''\n(If players choose \"How did you meet Drakon?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me how you met.''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''It's a tale for the ages. I moved to Thebes with dreams of becoming a great champion. I came to this gym and saw him... A mighty warrior with an even mightier smile. I wanted to learn from the best, but the only muscle he truly worked on was my heart.''\n(If players choose \"Why do you love Drakon?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're going to a lot of effort for Drakon. Is he worth it?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''He's a living, breathing [[Herakles]]\u2014you tell me.''\n(If players choose \"Where is Drakon?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If he's not here, where is he?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Normally we're both here night and day. The only time he leaves is to perform at the [[Drakon's Training Site|training ground]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll go find the herbalist\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go find that herb for you.''\nKassandra left the gymnasium and traveled to the [[Scorched Rolling Plains]] to find the herbalist. She spotted a farmhouse and beside it a silo that had a red cloth on it with the help of [[Ikaros]]. \n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the place.''\nWhen she arrived at the farm she found a farmer surrounded by bandits.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Don't. Don't.''\n*'''Archer:''' ''Then get her out of the house. You die if she doesn't.<br>The farm is'' ours.\nKassandra fought the bandits and defeated them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bandits! What a surprise...''\nKassandra freed the farmer who had been tied up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're gone, you can come out now.''\n[[File:ACOD - Boeotian herbalist.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra meeting the herbalist]]\nThe herbalist opened the farmhouse door which had been barred against the bandits.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''. If you hadn't intervened we'd surely be dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They must have really wanted something from you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''The farm. It's one of the few untouched by the war. Herbs aren't free, you know. They'd uproot 'em and sell 'em.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Speaking of herbs, that's why I'm here. I need to buy one for a man named Melanippos. Says he knows you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''That troublemaker still wants to make the love potion?''\nThe herbalist turned around and closed the door to the house.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Well, he'll have it his way. I can sell you the herb he needs.''\n<tabber>\n|-|But I saved you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I saved your farm. I feel like that deserves some gratitude.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''I have to make a living, don't I?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFine, take your drachmae.

I risked my life for you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''I never asked you to, but suit yourself. You won't find anyone else with this herb in Boeotia.''\n}}\n|-|Here's the drachmae. [1000]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine, here's the [[drachma]]e.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''On second thought, you did save Episthenes and me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.''\n|-|I'm not paying.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think exchanging herbs for your life is a fair trade.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''While I'm thankful for your help, I didn't ask for it. I can't be giving my herbs away for free in such trying times.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFine, take your drachmae.

[500]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here's the drachmae.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''On second thought, you did save Episthenes and me. Here, take the herb.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you, I appreciate the gesture.''\n|-|I'm leaving.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I shouldn't have to pay after risking my life for you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Suit yourself, but no one else in Boeotia has this herb.''\nKassandra came back later to pay for the herb.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Ready to pay now?''\n(Back to dialogue choice one.)\n</tabber>\nKassandra returned to Melanippos at the gymnasium with the herbs.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There, your herb. It better be worth all the trouble.''\n[[File:ACOD - Melanippos celebrating.png|thumb|250px|Melanippos rejoicing]]\nMelanippos was delighted and begun to sing.\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''Yes, yes. Drakon is mine 'til the end of time. Maybe I'll take him for a moonlit walk at the [[Site of Iphigenia's Sacrifice]]... He won't have to go far from his training site.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And his armor?''\n*'''Melanippos:''' ''It waits patiently for the potion in my house.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. Be sure you take your time with it... for the potion to work best.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra obtained the herbs [[Melanippos]] required to make his love potion. Melanippos stole [[Drakon]]'s armor to apply the potion and Drakon was weakened when he and Kassandra finally met.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*This quest is missable: finishing [[The End of Drakon]] removes the quest.\n*It is possible to avoid paying the herbalist for the herbs by killing her and looting them from her corpse.\n**Alternatively, saving her husband, walking away from the first offer and returning reduces her asking price by half.\n*Completing this quest strips Drakon of his armor, making him more vulnerable in a fight if not allowing for a one-hit assassination.",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached the man playing his lyre.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That sounds sad.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''I'm playing for Abreas, my brother.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happened to him?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''He was deceived and murdered by [[Astra]] and [[Deianeira]].<br />I hoped if I played near water, he might hear the music as he travels down the [[Styx]].''\n(Asked \"Why was he killed?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would anyone want to kill your brother?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Abreas spoke out against the alliance with the [[Athens|Athenians]] and accused the [[Champions of Boeotia|champions]] of betraying [[Boeotia]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Seems like he doubted Deianeira's loyalty.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''He was right. She lured him out to the old sparring grounds and killed him to send a message to the rest of the region.''\n(Asked \"Who are Deianeira and Astra?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Should I have heard those names?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Deianeira is a champion of Boeotia, and Astra is her cousin. They do everything together - even kill.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wouldn't expect someone of such renown to need help.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Abreas and I used to spar with them as children. They work as one, covering each other's weaknesses.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then they'll be weaker alone.''\n(Chose \"You deserve justice.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've lost family too. It's your duty to avenge him.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''I don't want to kill Deianeira. I want Astra killed instead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to kill her cousin?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Exactly!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|All right, I'll do it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll kill Astra for you.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''When they killed Abreas, they took a necklace I made him. I want it back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what I can do.''\n|-|Leave \u2013 I can't right now.=\n(Back to dialogue options.)\n</tabber>\n(Asked \"Where will I find Astra?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Boeotia is large, and I don't have time to waste.''\n[[File:ACOD Sibling Revenge 2.png|thumb|250px|Timon directing Kassandra to Astra's location]]\n*'''Timon:''' ''Of course. The [[Astra's Training Grounds|camp]] lies on the northern shoreline of [[Lake Kopais]].''\n(Asked \"Why not have Deianeira killed?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why not simply kill Deianeira?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''She and Astra are very close, as close as Abreas and I were. I want her to feel the same pain, the same loss. Death would be too easy for her.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I've heard enough.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see your vengeance delivered.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios.'' Deianeira and her mercenaries have a camp east of the [[City of Orchomenos|Orchomenos]]. You'll likely find Astra there.''\nKassandra traveled to the northern shore of Lake Kopais, finding Astra in the camp.\n[[File:ACOD Sibling Revenge 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra clashing with Astra]]\n*'''Astra:''' ''I'll kill you and make my cousin proud!''\nKassandra killed Astra and retrieved the necklace from her corpse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I hope this necklace brings him some peace.''\nKassandra returned to Timon.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Astra's dead. You have your vengeance.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''I thought I'd feel relieved.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But you don't.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''This is a wound justice won't heal.<br />Did you... Did Astra have my brother's necklace?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Here's the necklace.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Thank you, mercenary. I made this for my brother when he was younger, so he would never be alone hunting or fighting.''\nKassandra handed Timon the necklace.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now I need something from you.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Anything.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to know where Deianeira is.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 I couldn't find it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I searched Astra's body, but found no necklace.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''I wanted something to remember him by.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You got your vengeance - it should be enough. I still need the information about Deianeira.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Timon:''' ''If she wasn't at the camp, she is likely at the [[Cave of the Oracle|cave of the oracle]], at the heart of [[Reborn Hills|Reborn Hill]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Cave of the Oracle?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''It's a local shrine, Deianeira often goes there to pray and seek guidance. Perhaps the oracle told her to kill my brother.''\n(\"What's next?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What will you do now?''\n*'''Timon:''' ''I suppose I'll try and get back to living... alone.''\n(\"Join my crew.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now that your quest for vengeance is complete, why not start a new life? I could always use a man like you on the ''[[Adrestia]].\n*'''Timon:''' ''Yes. A fresh start would be good. The gods made us cross paths, after all.''\nShe stepped closer to him and clapped him on the back.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Glad to have you with us.''\n([LEAVE] \"I have what I need.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to be going.''\n*'''Timon:''' ''Thank you for bring me justice.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gods be with you.''\nKassandra left.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra killed Astra, separating Deianeira from her greatest support.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Merely accepting this quest forcibly separates Deianeira and Astra, removing them from their regular looping roam around Boeotia and relegating them to the [[Training Camp]] and [[Astra's Training Grounds]], respectively. Deianeira is considerably weakened just from this separation but still has Cultist guards at the Training Camp. Fully completing the quest as intended will move her to the [[Cave of the Oracle]], alone, with no witnesses or support, and seated on the ground for an easy stealth attack.\n*This quest is no longer available once Deianeira is killed. If she is killed while the quest is in progress, Astra will remain in her training grounds, but killing her will not retrieve the amulet or provide XP for the quest.\n*If the quest is completely fully and as intended, Timon can be recruited to join the ''[[Adrestia]]'' as a Legendary-rank lieutenant.\n*Until players have started the storyline that takes them to Boeotia, they cannot interact with Timon before starting this quest. Instead, Timon will remain standing at the port and will be marked in-game as \"essential\". Oddly, other parts of the quest remain accessible: Astra will attack players on sight when roaming Boeotia, despite players not knowing her reasons why or who the \"Deianeira\" is she mentions, and she can be pre-emptively killed before even starting the mission, preventing players from accessing it at all.",

    "Section_Trivia": "*If Nikolaos survived the events of [[The Wolf of Sparta]], he'll kill Aristaios instead in a cutscene that plays as the player gets close. During this conversation, Nikolaos can be convinced to reunite with Stentor and provide him guidance, which has major consequences for both the end of the Boeotia campaign and the ending of the main quest.\n**Thus, players who want to explore both outcomes should kill the other three champions ([[Nesaia]], [[Deianeira]], and [[Drakon]]) first and save before approaching the two fighting.\n*If Nikolaos was not spared in \"The Wolf of Sparta\", Aristaios can be knocked out and recruited as a lieutenant aboard the ''[[Adrestia]]''.",

Nesaia can't be far away.''\nKassandra noticed a bloody track on the road exiting the camp.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These tracks don't look [[human]]. They lead away from the camp to the north.''\nFollowing the trail, [[Ikaros]] tracked down Nesaia with her bear near a watchtower near a river, or at the [[Healing Sanctuary of Amphiaraos]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There stalks the mighty hunter.''\nKassandra engaged the champion and slew her.",

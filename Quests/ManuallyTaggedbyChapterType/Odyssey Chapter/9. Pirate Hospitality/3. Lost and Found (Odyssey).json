    "Section_Dialogue": "In pursuit of the [[Red in the Wreckage|shipwrecked]] supply of [[miltos]], Kassandra found a [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Gotarzes|captain]] accosted by his crew on the island of [[Lestris]].\n*'''Soldier:''' ''Every time, Gotarzes!''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Now, I know the situation doesn't look good...''\n*'''Thug:''' ''Doesn't look good! We're fucking marooned!''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''You can't blame me for the rocks.''\n*'''Thug:''' ''You're the captain. We fucking blame you for crashing!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra approached the pirates=\nKassandra approached the pirates.\n*'''Thug:''' ''It was simple. An unarmed [[merchant]] ship! You gave that to [[Poseidon]], and then ran us onto the rocks.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''We aren't far from [[Keos]]. Someone'll find us.''\n*'''Thug:''' ''I hope the [[Great white shark|sharks]] find ''you'' first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stop!''\n*'''Thug:''' ''Keep the fuck out of this. the captain's gonna get what's comin' to him!''\n(If players choose \"What's going on?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What has this man done?''\n*'''Thug:''' ''What hasn't he done?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did he offend you\u2014poor, delicate pirates?''\n*'''Thug:''' ''Should never have agreed to work with this ''mal\u00e1kas''. We finally get a job from [[Xenia]], and he sails us into the fucking ground.'' \n(If players choose  \"Why are you here?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How did you end up on this island?''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''I can explain. I am the captain...''\n*'''Thug:''' ''Oh, we've heard enough from you, ''captain.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll hear it from the captain himself.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''As I was saying... We got into a great sea battle\u2014which we won, thanks to me\u2014and the victory was so sweet! I didn't notice how close to the rocks we were. A minor accident. Now, if you could just get us back to Keos?''\n(If players choose \"This man's your captain.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This man is your captain.''\n*'''Thug:''' ''You can only be captain if you got a ship, and he ain't got one no more.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''I can make it worth your while if you get me back to Keos.''\n*'''Thug:''' ''Stand aside.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nOrder must be upheld.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get out of my way. I'm taking Captain Gotarzes back to Keos.''\n*'''Thug:''' ''You'll be sorry you stuck your nose in where it don't belong. He's fucked us over too many times. No, the Captain won't leave here alive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get behind me and stay close.''\nThe mutineers attacked both of them. \n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''By the gods, help me!''\nKassandra slew them all and spoke to Gotarzes.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nDo as you see fit.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's your crew. Answer to them.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Please no, you must protect me!''\n*'''Thug:''' ''Make your peace with Poseidon, Captain.''\nThe mutineers attacked Gotarzes.\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''By the gods, help me!''\nGotarzes, outnumbered, gets killed and the quest fails. \n}}\n(Gotarzes lived and the mutineers lay dead. She spoke to him.)\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Some fight, eh? Thank you, stranger. Now if you can just get me to Keos, there's a reward in it for you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There better be. You've seen what happens to people I disagree with.<br>Let's get to my [[Adrestia|ship]] and get you home, then.''\n|-|If Kassandra ambushed the pirates right away=\nBefore they could do anything to Gotarzes, Kassandra ambushed the mutineers, killing them all. She spoke to Gotarzes.\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Thank you. Knowingly or not, you've just saved my life.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And was it worth saving?''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Get me back to Keos, and I'll pay you handsomely.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'd better get you to my ship then.''\n</tabber>\nGotarzes was given passage aboard the ''Adrestia''.\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Ah! What a relief it will be to go back to Keos. Sure, Xenia will be angry that I don't have the ''miltos...'' But I can deal with that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why's the ''miltos'' so important?''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''What kind of pirate are you? It's nearly as valuable as gold!''\n(If the Adrestia encounters and is engaged by a pirate ship.)\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''We've got company. Friend of yours?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You go to one symposium, and everyone wants to know you!''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''I should never have gone back out to sea.''\nThe ship eventually docked in [[Koressia]]'s harbor once more. Xenia was relieved to see Gotarzes.\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Gotarzes!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's... not what I expected.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Gotarzes! I thought I'd lost you this time. Where's your ship?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|He was careless.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He sailed too close to the shore. The ship got caught on the rocks.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''We were in the middle of a raging battle!''\n|-|It doesn't matter.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The ship is gone, but he's alive.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''And you think his life is worth a ship?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ships can be rebuilt. A life cannot.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''You've spent too much time with [[Athens|Athenians]].''\n|-|Lie \u2013 There was an accident.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The rocks around the isle were treacherous.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Oh, I'm well aware of his nautical prowess. A [[goat]] could sail those waters.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Mal\u00e1ka. What's important is that you're alive, brother.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's your brother?''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''It would be easier if he wasn't.<br />What happened to the crew?''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Those dogs turned on me. If it wasn't for this ''misthios\u2014\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He would be dead.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Then you will be rewarded, ''misthios.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That's not necessary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Family is family. No reward necessary.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''No. I am in your debt.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Your armor Gotarzes. Give it to her.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''But this was father's. It's mine by birthright.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Now.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''His armor\u2014''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Belongs to someone worthy of it.''\n|-|That's what he promised me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gotarzes promised a reward. A substantial one, if I remember it right.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Pay her, then.''\n*'''Gotarzes:''' ''Me? But you're the one who\u2014<br>Fine...''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Come with me, stupid brother.''\n*'''Xenia:''' ''Thank you, Kassandra. Family is family, and for his life I thank you.''\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Gotarzes was rescued from his self-marooning and returned to Xenia.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*If the player refuses to help Gotarzes, he may still survive the fight for the continuation of the quest. However, if he dies, the mission will instantly fail.\n*The [[drachma]]e reward for the quest is the same, regardless of the player's final choice. The [[Captain's Chest]] chest piece, however, is Epic-grade when refusing a reward and Rare-grade when accepting one. The Epic-grade version appears to increase health in addition to both pieces' increasing of warrior damage and total armor.\n*After the mission, Gotarzes can be attacked and recruited to your crew.",

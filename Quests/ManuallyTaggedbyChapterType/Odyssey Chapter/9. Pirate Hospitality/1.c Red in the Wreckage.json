    "Section_Dialogue": "While in Keos, Kassandra overheard two men talking near the port.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Can you fucking believe it?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Thought she'd know better by now.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Well, you know why. Shame though, all that cargo out there on the [[Aegean Sea|ocean]]...''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''More like under, knowing [[Gotarzes]]!''\nThe two men laughed. Intrigued, Kassandra approached the men.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''I mean how hard is it to take a [[merchant]] [[ship]] and get to [[Thera]] and back?!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Still, [[Xenia]] could've used that ''miltos''. The [[drachma]]e would have been helpful in her fight against...''\nThe men noticed Kassandra and shut up.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Something we can help you with?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yeah, you were talking about a shipment.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''We weren't saying nothing... Nothing that concerns you, anyway.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Spit it out.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were, and I want to know more.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Yeah, don't really care what you want.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou'd better tell me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'd better tell me about that ''miltos'' shipment.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Don't have to tell you shit.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Don't even try it. We're under Xenia's protection here, like everyone else.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Go on, get out of here.''\nKassandra left, only to change her mind and return later to try talking to them again.\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Told you, nothing more to say.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''You want that shipment? Lot of water between here and Thera, better get to it.''\nKassandra returned to the ''Adrestia''.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it's worth money, I'll find it. They said the ship was on its way to Thera.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nSorry, just inquisitive.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Apologies, I... I've been at sea, and my curiosity got the better of me.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Huh, no worry about manners here. Cause trouble, though, and you'll answer to Xenia.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Yeah, we've both been to sea. Boring as fuck, and no one minded their manners on any of the vessels I sailed.''\nThe two men laughed.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI want to find this shipment.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like to find this ship.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Well, I'll help you if you can. Then you can bring us a story.''\n(If \"What was the cargo?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's ''miltos'', anyway?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' Miltos'', the next best thing to [[gold]].''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Fucking [[Athens|Athenians]] want it all for themselves, self-important ''mal\u00e1kas''.''\n(If \"Where's the shipment?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know where I can find the ship?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Could be anywhere, knowing Gotarzes!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''I heard the plan was to intercept the shipment near [[Lestris]] island, due south of Keos.''\n(If \"Who's Gotarzes?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who's this captain you keep mentioning?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Gotarzes, be thankful you don't know.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''The [[Parthenon]]'s got more chance of staying afloat than him!''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I know what do.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''If you find that ''miltos'', be sure to come back and share the wealth!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course, my friends!''\nKassandra turned and walked away from the laughing men.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Mal\u00e1kes.''\nKassandra returned to the ''Adrestia'' and set sail for Lestris.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I can find this shipment of ''miltos''...

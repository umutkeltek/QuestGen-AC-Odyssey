    "Section_Dialogue": "While in [[Koressia]], Kassandra heard a woman wailing near the port.\n*'''[[Obelia]]:''' ''My plans! They're ruined.<br>How will I find it without the tablet?!<br>That double-crossing'' mal\u00e1kas''!''\nKassandra approached the woman.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You sound troubled.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''I'm trying to steal [[Xenia]] a great treasure to celebrate her victory over [[Keos]], but the directions have been stolen.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And I suppose you want someone to steal them back?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''I tried, but they were stolen by the leader of Koressia, who Xenia banished from the city. There's a new truce between them, and no [[Piracy|pirate]] would touch that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lucky for you I'm not pirate.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Are you saying you'll help me? There's something in it for you if you do.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I suppose I could get your directions.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''[[Poseidon]] blesses me with good fortune at last!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, where am I going?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''To the other side of the island. You'll find the tablet in the leader's [[Leader House, Pirate Islands|house]] there. Once you have it, head to the nearby Village of [[Poiessa Village|Poieessa]] and deliver it to my associate.''\n(If \"Where is the house?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said the leader's house is near Poieessa?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Yes. To the south of the village.''\n(If \"Where is the village?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is Poieessa?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''It's on the east coast of the island of Keos.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll get going.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry, I'll get what you want.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Xenia will be thrilled! I await your return.''\nKassandra headed to the Leader House near the village. She identified the building with [[Ikaros]]' help.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If there is a map, it's in there.''\nKassandra infiltrated the house and found the map.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be what she wants.''\nKassandra left the Leader House and approached Poieessa Village. She found Obelia looking over some wares and approached her.\n*'''Obelia:''' ''This all looks so... boring.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you doing here?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Oh, me? I was just... in the area.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happened to your associate?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''He had other business to attend to. Left in a hurry, so I came to meet you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Did you get the tablet?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Here's the tablet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I guess I'll be paid handsomely then.''\n|-|Pay me first.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Before I hand over anything, I want my [[drachma]]e.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Obelia:''' ''But of course. You're a woman after my own heart, you know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thanks. Here's the tablet.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Excellent! Now we can really get to the matter at hand. Let's see what we have here.''\nObelia read the tablet.\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Hmm... This is interesting. The treasure is hidden in some [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Submerged Minoan Palace|ruins]]... But it's underwater.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't swim.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''I'm a pirate, course I can fucking swim. I... just don't like [[Great white shark|sharks]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you're a coward, not a weakling.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''I don't need to swim if I have a reliable [[mercenary]] to do it for me.''\n<tabber>\n|-|This is beneath me.=\n\n|-|I like adventures.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I might be interested in an adventure.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''I can promise you this will be one to remember, else Poseidon's [[trident]] spear me and drag me to the crushing deep.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I suppose I can help you recover your treasure.''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''I knew you wouldn't be able to resist! Poseidon blesses me with good fortune at last!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where am I going?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Here, take this key and head to the southern tip of Keos. You'll find the entrance to the ruins there.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's sticky... is that blood?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Gods no, must have been the pomegranate I ate earlier. Hurry now, time's a-wastin'.''\n(If \"What am I looking for?\" was chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What exactly is this treasure?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''It's said to be the [[Ancient Ruins of Kunastros]], so the treasure must be a rare artifact from before the island was settled.''\n(If \"What can I expect?\" was chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's it like down there?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''The treasure is guarded by a frenzy of sharks. You'll find it in a chest at the heart of the island.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well if it had been an easy job you'd have done it yourself.''\n(If \"What are the ruins?\" was chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How will I know if I'm looking in the right place?''\n*'''Obelia:''' ''Head south from the [[Lost Garden of Bacchylides]]. Even though the ruins are underwater, you'll see them just off the coast.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll get your treasure.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get you what you want.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped Obelia recover a tablet leading to an ancient Minoan treasure. In exchange for the tablet, Obelia gave Kassandra a key to an ancient Minoan chest with an artifact worth a great deal of drachmae.",

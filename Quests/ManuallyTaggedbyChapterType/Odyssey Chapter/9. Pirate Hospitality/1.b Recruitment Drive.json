    "General_Description": "'''Recruitment Drive''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra came across [[Xenia]]'s [[Xenia's Steward|steward]], who requested her display [[Keos]] colors and destroy vessels as a warning to any who would oppose Xenia.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "While in [[Koressia]], Kassandra came across a one-eyed [[Piracy|pirate]], who was fixing a broken [[ship]].\n*'''Steward:''' ''Sails need repair. Three broken oars on the top level. Two on the second level. Cracked spar.<br>Never a day's rest, by [[Jupiter|Zeus]]...''\nKassandra approached the pirate.\n*'''Steward:''' ''What do you need?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is this a bad time?''\n*'''Steward:''' ''Every time's a bad time. There's too much work and not enough people to do it. But I'm the only person who cares about that. Wait. Did Xenia sent you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She said you'd have work for me.''\n*'''Steward:''' ''Well thank [[Poseidon]]. Finally! Someone competent to help!<br>Ships are pushing into our territory and test us. Xenia wants to send a message to make sure people understand who owns this little part of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].''\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 I'll help you.=\n\"What kind of message?\"\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What kind of message do you want to send?''\n*'''Steward:''' ''Sinking some ships while flying her colors should do the trick.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's one way to do it.''\n*'''Steward:''' ''We're still pirates. We've got a reputation to uphold in these waters, and nothing says, \"respect me\" like a bit of blood spilling.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds to me like you're weakening the competition. Keos not big enough for your ambitions?''\n*'''Steward:''' ''If we were going to take more territory we wouldn't be hiring the [[Mercenary|likes]] of you. We'd do it ourselves. Best way to prevent an attack is to strike first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No arguments here.''\n|-|I'm not interested.=\n(Return to first dialogue option)\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll sink the ships for you. What am I targeting?''\n*'''Steward:''' ''Destroy a few ships from [[Sparta]], a few from [[Athens]], and a few bandit ones, too.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a lot of ship sinking.''\n*'''Steward:''' ''Just make sure you're flying Xenia's colors when you do the sinking. I'll pay you well to ensure the message is understood.''\nKassandra headed to the ''[[Adrestia]]'' and donned the colors of Keos. She set out and eliminated 2 ships belonging to each group: the Athenians, the Spartans, and the bandits. After doing so, she returned to the steward.\n*'''Steward:''' ''Yes?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've sunk the ships.''\n*'''Steward:''' ''I knew I liked you. Xenia will be pleased that her waters are back under her control.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Flattery is fine, but I'm here for the bounty.''\n*'''Steward:''' ''Of course.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra donned the colors of Xenia's pirates and sank a handful of ships belonging to all major naval powers, sending the message Xenia hoped to convey.",

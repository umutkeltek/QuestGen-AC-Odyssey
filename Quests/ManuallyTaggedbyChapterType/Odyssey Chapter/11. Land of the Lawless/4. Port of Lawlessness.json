    "General_Description": "'''Port of Lawlessness''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Following [[Anthousa]]'s advice, Kassandra set out to destroy the [[The Monger's Warehouse|warehouse]] which belonged to [[the Monger]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra infiltrated the warehouse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is the place. Time to burn some cargo.''\nWithin, she found victims of the Monger, tied up and awaiting to be shipped off and sold into [[slavery]]. Kassandra freed the people, and set fire to the Monger's cargo of contraband. Drawn by the fire, the Monger's men found Kassandra and attacked her. However, [[Brasidas]], a [[Sparta]]n officer, threw his [[spear]] into an assailant to make his entrance. He retrieved his spear and goaded the others to attack.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Come and get it.''\nThe two Spartans worked together to defeat the superior numbers and burst out of the blazing warehouse to dispatch those who remained outside. They exchanged greetings after the fight.\n[[File:ACOD Port of Lawlessness 13.png|thumb|250px|Aftermath of the fight]]\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You fight like a Spartan! There's resolve in you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We have that in common.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I saw innocents trapped in the flames.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|If freed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The ones in the warehouse? I freed them already.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''A good soldier acts when he's told. A great one is two steps ahead. Thank you.''\n|-|If trapped=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did what I could. The flames were thick.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Not everyone can be spared of Hades. My thanks anyways.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My name's Kassandra. I'd thank you too if I knew who you were.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Brasidas of Sparta. You're a newcomer to Korinth.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a spy too?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''An old Spartan tactic. I have my ways.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I get the sense that's a Korinthian hobby. Anthousa has her ''hetaerae'' watching from every post.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Ah, Anthousa. We disagree, but have a common enemy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Monger?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''We agree he should be killed, but we differ on ''how.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me your plan.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you want to do with him?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Right now, the Monger rules Korinth. I want to replace him with minimal bloodshed.''\n|-|What can you tell me about the Monger?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, Sparta also has a Monger problem. What do you know about him?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''His weapon has a far reach. Korinth is allied with Sparta. It's our duty to protect them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then working alongside Anthousa is your best bet.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''If she had her way, the Monger would be flayed in the streets. Sparta wants him dealt with quietly.''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|He needs to die.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'll only be dethroned if he's killed. It's simple.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Yes, diplomacy isn't something he understands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From what I hear, I'm not surprised.''\n|-|Killing him isn't peaceful.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing him and his men doesn't seem to fit your peaceful proposal.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Nothing else has been successful. Trust me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happened?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''We arrested his top men. Armed the [[Civilian|citizens]]. Tried to stir the polis against him. It never came to be. The only thing left to try\u2014''\nHe made a slashing motion with his hand towards Kassandra.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''\u2014is a quick slice of the blade.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That would do it.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''We'd lure him into Korinthia's [[Sacred Cave]], and it'd be over.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I can help you bring the Monger down.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By the time I leave Korinthia, the Monger will be dead.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Do that, and Sparta will be in your debt.''\n|-|I agreed to help Anthousa, not you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anthousa has given me her word, and I've given her mine. She's hired me to kill the Monger.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''She did?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She has something I need, and the Monger's in my way.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Keep your [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]] pointed his way, and Sparta will thank you.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra divulged her origins to Brasidas.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was Spartan once.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Once?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Until I was thrown off [[Mount Taygetos]] as a child and left for dead.''\nShe turned and walked towards the pier. Brasidas was stunned as he realized who exactly she was.\n[[File:ACOD Port of Lawlessness 16.png|thumb|250px|Brasidas learning of Kassandra's lineage]]\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''You're the daughter of General [[Nikolaos]]? All of Sparta knows your name! And here you are\u2014alive\u2014impossible.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I survived. I raised myself alone while life continued in Sparta.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Never mind being a Spartan. Those of good character will forgive, and should be forgiven.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm on the hunt for my mother, [[Myrrine]], and the only way is through Anthousa.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Yes. Myrrine.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|No reason to dwell on the past.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no going back now.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''The displaced can always find their way home. The gods have just decided you must fight for it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They couldn't make it any easier?''\n|-|How did you know my father?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You knew Nikolaos.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''A good general, but a stubborn Spartan.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And rewarded for his loyalty.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nNikolaos spared in The Wolf of Sparta=\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''But he disappeared, and his body was never found. The state pronounced him dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all right. I haven't seen him since I was a child.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nNikolaos killed in The Wolf of Sparta=\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Devoted to Sparta until the end. I'm sorry. You heard of his death?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did. A shame.''\n}}\n|-|What do you know about Myrrine?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't know anything about Myrrine, do you?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I know that no one should have to endure such tragedy alone. And I heard she left Sparta that night. No one has forgotten Myrrine.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From what I know, she wanted them to forget.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Port of Lawlessness 17.png|thumb|250px|Brasidas and Kassandra part ways]]\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Chin up, Spartan. Easy doesn't exist.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Goodbye, Brasidas.''\nThe two shook hands.\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''We'll meet again. I'm in the fight with you. Show courage.''\nBrasidas walked away while Kassandra looked out at the bay.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra destroyed the Monger's warehouse, sending a powerful message to Korinth and the Monger, and met Brasidas in the process.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Killing the Monger's men during the final fight with Brasidas triggers murder bounties for each kill. Either they can act as witnesses to each other's murder, or Brasidas is improperly flagged as a potential witness to crimes, as there are no other NPCs around during this fight.\n:*To avoid this, simply damage them just enough that Brasidas can deliver the killing blow. Alternatively, players can use the automatic bounty(ies) to lure in bounty hunters to kill and raise the hero's mercenary rank, but be warned that allied NPCs like Brasidas will not aid the player in mercenary fights.",

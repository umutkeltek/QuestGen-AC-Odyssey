    "Section_Description": "Kassandra approached [[Damalis]], one of [[Anthousa]]'s followers.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "After talking with [[Anthousa]], Kassandra located Damalis outside at the [[Spring of Peirene]].\n*'''Damalis:''' ''So you're here to help us, ''misthios''? You don't ''look'' like a [[The Monger|Monger]] spy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm more the in-your-face type. You have a Monger problem, Damalis?''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''I might. One of my regulars has... changed. He was a decent man once, but now, he's gone bad.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Korinth]] seems to have a shortage of \"decent\" people.''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''I need someone with muscle to figure out what's behind the change. ''Why'' he's different.''\n<tabber>\n|-|What is the man doing wrong?=\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 01.png|thumb|250px|Damalis speaking to Kassandra]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's gotten you scared.''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''He asks me questions I don't know the answers to about our [[drachma]]e. Where we keep money, what Anthousa invests in. As though we're [[Athens|Athenian]] aristocrats.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can't Anthousa intervene?''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''I'm not naive! I won't expose others to this. So he can go after them next?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He might anyway. Sounds like he needs answers.''\n|-|What was he like before?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who was he before all this?''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''Obsessive, but never threatening. He didn't stand out in symposiums, until he had his drachmae act for him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, something's sure giving him courage now.''\n|-|I'll go talk to him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what he has to say for himself.''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''If he's not lurking around here, he'll be at his house. I want this to end ''today''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will. People tend to show their true selves to my [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]] whether they like it or not.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra left the Spring in search of the client's house. Outside of the house, she heard a familiar voice calling to her.\n*'''[[Phoibe]]:''' ''Kassandra! It's me! Kassandra!''\nKassandra approached Phoibe.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Good, you found me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Shh!'' What are you doing here?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I heard Damalis talking about her crazy client earlier and I wanted to help!''\n<tabber>\n|-|You better behave.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine. But you have to do as I say. No games!''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I know that already\u2014because you never let me have any fun!''\n|-|Good idea, Phoibe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You may be right. I could use you.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''See? That was my plan all along!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm going to talk to Damalis' client and see what he has to say.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I've been here. Spying. And I heard him mumbling to himself! He's weird. But maybe if I tell you what he said, it could help?''\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 03.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra accepting Phoibe's help]]\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me what he said.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's hear it.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Let me think... He said something about having to meet someone at [[Phaia's Pig Farm|Pig Farm]] tonight. That could help!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It could. Did he mention why?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''To get something from them. A deed to some land, I think he said.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, that's something. What else?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Oh, he said their name! [[Deinomenes]]. Wonder who that is?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good to know. Thank you, Phoibe the spy.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Not bad, huh?''\n|-|No, let's get to work=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to act. Listen closely. You sneak inside and see what you can find in his house while I distract him.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Quiet like a mouse!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. But if you get caught, run. Right out the door. We'll meet afterwards. Promise?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I'm ready. Let's go!''\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 04.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra confronting the client]]\nWhile Phoibe snuck around the rear of the house, Kassandra entered the home and confronted the client.\n*'''Client:''' ''Do I know you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No. But I know you.''\n*'''Client:''' ''If [[Myron]] sent you, tell him I was going to pay him back this very night!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No one sent me. We need to talk. I know you're up to something\u2014''\n*'''Client:''' ''Something? Something could be anything! You have nothing on me.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You have a meeting at Phaia's goat farm.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're meeting someone tonight, aren't you? At Phaia's [[goat]] farm.''\n*'''Client:''' ''A goat farm? You'll find no goats at Phaia's.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh, I...''\nThe man noticed Phoebe sneaking through his house.\n*'''Client:''' ''Wait! [[Thief]]! Thieves! Get out! [[Guard]]s! Get them!''\nKassandra was forced to kill the client and the guards before meeting back up with Phoibe.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''What was all that noise?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Damalis doesn't have to worry about her client now.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''That wasn't what she wanted you to do!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I dealt with him, didn't I?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Well... At least I could sneak in OK. Look!''\n|-|You have a meeting at Phaia's cow farm.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're meeting someone tonight, aren't you? At Phaia's [[Cattle|cow]] farm.''\n*'''Client:''' ''A cow farm? You'll find no cows at Phaia's.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh, I...''\nThe man noticed Phoebe sneaking through his house.\n*'''Client:''' ''Wait! Thief! Thieves! Get out! Guards! Get them!''\nKassandra was forced to kill the client and the guards before meeting back up with Phoibe.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''What was all that noise?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Damalis doesn't have to worry about her client now.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''That wasn't what she wanted you to do!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I dealt with him, didn't I?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Well... At least I could sneak in OK. Look!''\n|-|You have a meeting at Phaia's pig farm.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're going to Phaia's Pig Farm. And meeting some like-minded person there, I hear.''\n*'''Client:''' ''Where did you hear that? You're wrong. Dead wrong.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're getting deed to some land.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They owe you a deed to some land. What that land'll be used for, I don't know.''\n*'''Client:''' ''A spy. What else do you have on me? Cough it up.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're meeting Deinomenes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Deinomenes will be quite upset if I don't let you meet him tonight.''\n*'''Client:''' ''How? What do you want?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know about Damalis. And as her client, you seem to think she owes you something.''\nIn the background, Phoibe left the house with her hands full.\n*'''Client:''' ''I ''do'' love her, you know. With my whole heart.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And yet, you're scaring her.''\n*'''Client:''' ''Better me than another more careless man. Either I hurt Damalis, or I'm killed!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not love, it's weakness.''\n*'''Client:''' ''You say it as though I don't know. He knew that too. That's why he's making me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who's making you?''\n*'''Client:''' ''Tell Damalis I'll stop. That I'm sorry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine. ''Chaire'', old man.''\nForlorn, the man turned back to his papers, and Kassandra left.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're meeting Deinomache.=\n(Man notices Phoibe, alerts guards, gets slain by Kassandra.)\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're meeting Deinokrates.=\n(Man notices Phoibe, alerts guards, gets slain by Kassandra.)\n}}\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're getting a secret letter.=\n(Man notices Phoibe, alerts guards, gets slain by Kassandra.)\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're getting a bill of sale.=\n(Man notices Phoibe, alerts guards, gets slain by Kassandra.)\n}}\n</tabber>\nOutside, Kassandra found Phoibe near a table with her loot.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's see what we found.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I wonder what this means?''\n<tabber>\n|-|What about the coin purse?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's this, a coin purse?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''His things aren't very nice, though. If he's rich, why have all that junk?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He must have just gotten paid.''\n|-|What about the iron poker?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've seen that iron poker [[The Serpent's Lair|used]] before.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''He didn't have a furnace! Why does he have this?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's not used for fire... It's a weapon. For torture. I saw someone use it in [[Phokis]]. Someone huge.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Huge like the Monger?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Just ''like the Monger.''\n|-|Let's see the letter.=\n</tabber>\nPhoibe showed Kassandra a letter.\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 08.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra Phoibe going through the loot]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What does the letter say?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''It's mean! It says he'll get hurt if he keeps doing things wrong.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought as much.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''And it says more... That he needs to bring Damalis to a [[Abron House|place]] here in Korinth. There's directions. What do you think it is?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't know... But I'll find out.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Right behind you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not this time. Go to Damalis and wait for me there.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Aw, please?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've done enough for today, It could be dangerous. I'll come find you after.''\n(If the players chose everything 'right' before.)\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Fine. I almost forgot. I got this [[sword]] for you from his house.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wow. You're a good thief.''\n(Kassandra received a randomly generated sword.)\nAs Phoibe left, Kassandra pondered while leaving to look for the place mentioned in the letter.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A place to bring Damalis. A prison? I should find out.''\nA short walk later, she found the location.\n[[File:ACOD_Abron_House.jpg|thumb|250px|The Abron House]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the place described in the letter. Anybody home?''\nShe investigated the area, coming across a large pot, covering a patch of blood-drenched ground.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's blood. Lots of it.''\nMaking her way inside the house, she discovered a collection of casts, mostly of breasts, on the wall.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''. What is this?''\nThe nearby desk had another clue.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A lock of hair. Smells familiar, somehow.''\nThere were also other curiosities in the place.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Chains? Oil? This can't be what I think it is.''\nA man entered the building, dragging and tossing Phoibe inside.\n*'''[[The Stalker]]:''' ''Gotcha! All right you little shit, who sent you?''\nPhoibe scurried behind Kassandra.\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 11.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra instructing Phoibe to run]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you doing here?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I wanted to help?''\n*'''The Stalker:''' ''Give her here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave, Phoibe. Now!''\nThe man moved to go after Phoibe as she ran past him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't take another step.''\n*'''The Stalker:''' ''You're brave coming here. You want a whipping? The Monger would ''love'' to take you on.''\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 12.png|thumb|250px|The Stalker confronting Kassandra]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'd rot in the [[underworld]] for that.''\n*'''The Stalker:''' ''Prude. This is [[Korinthia]]! Anything goes in this sex ''andron''. And the Monger ''will'' be satiated.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're as sick as he is, worm.''\n*'''The Stalker:''' ''Whether they like it or not, any victim he likes gets his special treatment. I'll tell him you volunteer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll get ''my'' special treatment right now. I'll fucking kill you.''\nKassandra did as she threatened, then returned to Damalis and Phoibe near a statue of [[Aphrodite]].\n*'''Damalis:''' ''Kassandra. Your little friend beat you back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You made it.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''And fast. I know all the shortcuts now. I'm sorry, Kassandra.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I forgive you, Phoibe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's all right. You had good intentions.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I thought I could sneak in... Like before.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad you didn't. Especially with what I found there.''\n|-|Don't do it again.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Listen next time I tell you to do something.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''OK.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I promise it's for your own good. This time, especially.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Damalis:''' ''What happened to you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I just left the Monger's sex ''andron'', if you can believe it. And it's where you were headed.''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''No.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's true. Your client was being forced to take you there. And we found these.''\n[[File:ACOD To Help A Girl 13.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra reporting her findings to Damalis]]\nKassandra handed Damalis the letters, and she read them.\n*'''Damalis:''' ''What does this mean?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It means the Monger got to him. He ''does'' have his hand in everything.''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''At least I know how to deal with him now that I know what he's after.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If the Client lives=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'll leave you alone now. He gave me his word.''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''So we really ''can'' trust you, can't we?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We're not all so easily blackmailed.''\n|-|If the Client died=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You won't have to. I took care of him myself.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I told Kassandra she shouldn't have!''\n*'''Damalis:''' ''It had to come to this. ''Mal\u00e1ka'', what a fool he was.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Monger's the real fool. He'll find that out soon enough.''\n</tabber>",

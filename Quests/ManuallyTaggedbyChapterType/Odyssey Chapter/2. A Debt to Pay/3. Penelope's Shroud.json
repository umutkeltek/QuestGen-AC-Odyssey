    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra departed the shore and [[Elpenor]] to recover [[Penelope]]'s Shroud. The island of [[Ithaka]] rested across the waters.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Headed to Odysseus's island on a tiny boat. Let\u2019s try not to piss off [[Poseidon]], shall we?''\nWorking through the ruins of [[Odysseus]]' [[Odysseus' Palace|Palace]], Kassandra came across [[Odessa]], imprisoned in a [[wood]]en cage. Kassandra freed Odessa after killing the guards.\n*'''Odessa:''' ''Hey, get me out of here!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's get out of here. Can you fight?''\n*'''Odessa:''' ''I'd be ''happy'' to.''\n(The above continues with the side quest [[A Small Odyssey]])\n\nKassandra found the shroud, intending to escape the Palace.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Penelope's shroud. In the flesh. I mean cloth.''\nHaving found the shroud, Kassandra left Ithaka and travelled to the [[Temple of Zeus (Kephallonia)|Temple of Zeus]] near [[Sami]]. There, she found Elpenor and his servant.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Kassandra. Good news, I hope.''\n[[File:ACOD_Penelope's_Shroud_-_Kassandra_Handing_Over_Shroud.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra with the shroud]]\nKassandra took out the shroud.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Safe and sound.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Well done. And now the shroud is yours.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't want it? After all that?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I gained something more valuable today. For your troubles, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''.''\nElpenor's servant tossed a bag of coins to the table before Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I knew any better, I'd think you were testing me.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Perhaps.''\nThe servant then handed Kassandra a scroll.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''You did well, ''misthios''. Tell me, how do you feel about killing a general in [[Megaris]]? Do this for me, and earn ''double'' what you earned today. Are you up to the task? It would take you far away from [[Kephallonia]]. So far away you might never return.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Military ranks mean nothing to me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Generals bleed like anyone else.''\n*'''Elpinor:''' ''Good.''\n|-|I'm a misthios, not an assassin.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not an assassin.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''There's a first time for everything.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''What do you say?''\n(If players choose \"Who is the general I have to kill?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who is this general?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''They call him \"[[Nikolaos|The Wolf]].\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He do something to offend you?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Yes... He's costing me drachmae. He's not good for business.''\n(If players choose \"What can you tell me about Megaris?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anything I should know about Megaris?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Only that it's the most valuable land in the [[Greece|Greek]] world, from a military perspective of course. Unfortunately for Megarians, it has two very powerful neighbors who just can't seem to play nice. In the tug of war between [[Korinth]] and [[Athens]], Megaris is the rope.''\n(If players choose \"Why choose me?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why me?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Because no one knows who you are. You're invisible.''\n(If players choose \"I'll take the contract.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I accept.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Splendid. You'll need a boat. You have one, don't you?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I have a boat.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course.''\n|-|I don't have a boat.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I had a boat, we wouldn't be having this conversation.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''A shame. It's too far of a swim I'm afraid, even for you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find one.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Good. I hope it's sturdy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And why is that?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''The seas are much more dangerous, I'm afraid. [[Peloponnesian War|War]] is coming, and the Wolf is on the wrong side.''\n(If players choose \"What war?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''War? With who?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''The entire Greek world is at each other's throats. What rock have you been hiding under, exactly?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kephallonia.''\n(If players choose \"Why should I trust you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And how do I know you're on the right side?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Because I'm the one paying you.''\n(If players choose\"I'm right for the job.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You won't be disappointed.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''When your job in Megaris is done, come find me at [[Pilgrim's Landing]] in [[Phokis]].''",

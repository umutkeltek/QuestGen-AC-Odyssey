    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra departed [[Markos' Vineyard]] and headed toward where the newcomers were located.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The abandoned house, and the people.''\nKassandra attacked those at the [[Abandoned House, Kephallonia|abandoned house]], eventually defeating the last thug. While he lay before Kassandra, [[Elpenor]] emerged to slit his throat.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I normally have someone else do the field work. I don't suppose ''you'' know how to get this stain out.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Stay back or else.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There'll be more blood if you step closer.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Perhaps. But then you won't hear my proposition, misthios.''\n|-|You get used to blood. I did.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It comes with the territory.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Then you're just the ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]'' I'm looking for.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Fancy Guest - Kassandra Questioning Elpenor.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra questioning Elpenor's actions]]\nElpenor looked at the nearby bodies.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''A clean slaughter. ''Very'' good work.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not much sympathy for the men who work with you.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Not with me, ''for'' me. Employees. Now ex-employees, I suppose.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you don't work for the [[Cyclops]].''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Your kind aren't usually believers of myth.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not the monster, the man. You ''are'' an outsider. Why are you here?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Indeed, I'm not from [[Kephallonia]]. I'm ''here'' because what I'm looking for ''is''. If you'll follow me, Kassandra.''\n[[File:ACOD Fancy Guest - Elpenor Kassandra Beach.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Elpenor at the beach]]\nKassandra followed Elpenor further to the beach.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who are you? How do you know my name?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I'm Elpenor of [[Kirrha]]. How do I know your name? I did what you did. I asked, and people told me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me who sent you.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''An inquisitive nature\u2014good. That will help.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know more than you let on.''\n[[File:ACOD Fancy Guests - Elpenor Proposal.png|thumb|250px|Elpenor proposing a deal with Kassandra]]\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Knowing you is in my best interest. And knowing ''me'' is in yours. My prized possession was stolen and brought to [[Ithaka]]. [[Penelope]]'s woven [[Shroud of Penelope|shroud]]. I need you to steal it back.''\n(If players choose \"What? Penelope's shroud?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The shroud of Penelope? The wife of [[Odysseus]]? You're joking.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''A piece of it, yes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Impossible. If it existed, it would be priceless.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Which is why I want it back.''\n(If players choose \"Where do I start looking?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ithaka is not a small island. I need more information.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I'd start at the home of Odysseus. Well, what's left of it. An inspiring tale. A reunion of past lovers.''\n(If players choose \"I'll get the shroud back.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll do it.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Don't expect it to be easy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's why it will cost you.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Then it's agreed. There's a rowboat in the harbor. Use it. It's not meant for open water, so be wise. When you have the shroud, meet me in the temple of [[Zeus]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Oh, and ''misthios''... Don't fail.''",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra departed the cliffs where she had finally met Nikolaos, returning to Barnabas aboard the ''[[Adrestia]]''.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''So, did you kill your father?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stepfather.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I suppose the gods won't judge you too harshly for a \"step-patricide.\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nikolaos raised me. Trained me. He was my father, even if he did try to kill me.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Is that better or worse? No matter. Yours isn't the only complicated family in the world.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Thanks for your concern.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thanks. I'm glad to have you around, Barnabas.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I'm happy to be here. Would anything else help?''\n|-|Mind your own business.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''if you're trying to make me feel better, stop.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''What would make you feel better then?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Finding my ''[[Myrrine|mater]]''. She's alive, Barnabas! At least... Nikolaos thought so.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Some good news, praise [[Hera]]. What's your plan? What course should I set, captain?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For now, we go to [[Phokis]]. [[Elpenor]] said he'd meet me there. He owes me money and an explanation.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Aye, Kassandra. And let's seek the wisdom of the [[Pythia]] while we're there. If anyone has answers for you, it's the Oracle of Delphi.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|The Oracle is a menace.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Oracle's predictions destroyed my family.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''The Pythia has the wisdom of Apollo himself! Now I'll admit, if people choose to ignore her, they might court disaster\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If we'd ignored the Pythia, my brother would still be alive and our mother would be safe at home.''\n|-|I'll consider seeing the Oracle.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll think about it.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Good. You know, kings and queens travel to Phokis to consult the Pythia. She can start wars or end them. They say that\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes, I know. That's enough Oracle talk for now.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Back to business. You know where to meet Elpenor, I suppose?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''His home is in [[Pilgrim's Landing]]. But... Nikolaos's last words to me were a warning of snakes in the grass.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Sounds like you should make extra preparations.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor is the one who should prepare.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Meet me at [[Apollo]]'s [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|temple]] in [[Sanctuary of Delphi|Delphi]] when you're done dealing with the snakes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor has a lot of explaining to do.''",

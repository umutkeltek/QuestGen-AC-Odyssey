    "General_Description": "'''The Paros Blockade''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "In an attempt to force [[Naxos Island]] into submission, [[Paros Island]]'s ships blockaded the [[Naxos]] harbor. [[Myrrine]], nor her daughter [[Kassandra]], would allow them to succeed.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "With her tasks completed, Kassandra returned to Myrrine at her [[Naxos villa|villa]], but [[Hektor]] entered with urgent news.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''You may speak.''\n*'''Hektor:''' ''Ships from [[Paros]] have blockaded the harbor.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Gods curse [[Silanos]] and his damned [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]]. Do they never tire of meddling?''\nFrustrated, she and [[Aspasia]] walked to the balcony to look out at the blockade.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Tell them I'm on my way.''\nHektor left as Kassandra joined them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A blockade?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''I've refused to pay tribute to [[Athens]], and Paros is taking advantage of the situation.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''There goes our hope of striking first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can bring my [[Adrestia|ship]] around and clear the harbor.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Just you against an entire blockade?''\n<tabber>\n|-|It will be easy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right. It's terrible odds for Paros.''\n|-|We have no choice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't see another option. But I have the best crew on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].''\n</tabber>\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Be safe... and come back to me, lamb.''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Paros_Blockade_-_Kassandra_Report_Mission.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra reporting her success]]\nKassandra took the ''Adrestia'' out to sea to meet the blockade. She sank all of the ships and returned to Myrrine at the port.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The harbor is clear. We need to move out before they send reinforcements.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''We're almost ready. [[Timo]]?''\n*'''Timo:''' ''The ships are loading now. They'll be ready on your command.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Kassandra. A word.''\n(If players asked \"What's wrong?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is something wrong?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Besides the attacks on my island and the Cult's meddling? No. But we must speak privately.''\n(If players chose \"Of course.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever you need.''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Paros_Blockade_-_Myrrine_Discussing_With_Kassandra.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra Myrrine discussing the Cult]]\nThe two walked away from the dock.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''The Cult must be stopped. When we return to [[Lakonia]], it will be dangerous.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm used to it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We both are.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Here, I know who I can and cannot trust. I would have said that about [[Sparta]], too. But this news about the [[Two Kings of Sparta|King]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did Aspasia find out ''which'' of the kings is working with the Cult?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''For all we know, it's both. We must cleanse [[Sparta]] of its corruption no matter the cost.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I stand with you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''At least now we can face them together.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Yes. For all that those bastards tried to take from us. And your [[Alexios|brother]]...<br>We will find him.''\n|-|We should focus on Paros.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Once Paros is dealt with, we will get to work.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''You're right.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Come see me when you're ready.''\nThey returned to Timo. Myrrine turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Are you ready to sail?''\n(If players asked \"Where are we sailing?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where to?''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''We're going to destroy the fleet of Paros once and for all. Only then will Naxos be secure enough for us to leave.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'm ready.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready.''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Paros_Blockade_-_Myrrine_Timo_Closeup.png|thumb|250px|Timo and Myrrine]]\nMyrrine turned to Timo.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Then I leave this to you.''\nThe two clasped each other's arms.\n*'''Timo:''' ''With your shield, or on it.''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''And now we strike a blow to the Cult.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassanda single-handedly smashed Paros's naval blockade, allowing Naxos to rally for a final assault on their fleet.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Timo's comment \"With your shield, or on it\" is a variant of a Spartan saying recorded by [[Plutarch]] in his ''{{Wiki|Moralia}}''. It may also be considered reference to the movie ''{{Wiki|300 (film)|300}}'', as Timo's words are verbatim.",

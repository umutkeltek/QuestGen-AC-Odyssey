    "General_Description": "'''He Waits''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Time had come for Kassandra test her mettle against the [[Minotaur]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Within the [[Knossos Palace]], Kassandra made her way down to the entrance of the [[Labyrinth of Lost Souls]] and inserted the [[Phaistos Disk]] into the stele. The massive trapdoor below parted open, and she and [[Ardos]] stood at the edge of the walkway to peer into the depths. Kassandra [[Leap of Faith|leapt]] into the pool of water far below, climbed out, and made her way past the glowing door. Inside, she took note of the [[Temple (Isu)|unusual architecture]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This... can't be [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]. What is this...?''\nShe rounded the corner and saw the massive labyrinth from [[Greek mythology|myth]] laid out before her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''. It's real. By the [[Twelve Gods|gods]]...''\nKassandra noticed a large string from a familiar myth tied to the stone path.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The string [[Theseus]] used to navigate the labyrinth... Let's see what's at the end.''\nShe followed the string around a corner and noticed a demolished and bloodied corpse slumped against the wall.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A creature of rage did this.''\nShe continued following the string and found a different corpse, that of a man.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be [[Nikios]].''\nShe inspected his remains and found a ring.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A ring? Ardos might want this.''\nThe string ended there, so Kassandra was left to navigate the rest of the maze on her own. As she explored, she was occasionally turned around.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've been this way before.''\nHer free running skills allowed her to collect many valuable treasures and traverse paths that had long since fallen into ruin. She followed the roaring sounds to the heart of the labyrinth and jumped across to its central chamber.\n\nInside, the half-man, half-bull of legend tossed a corpse aside and grabbed its [[Minotaur's Labrys|axe]] before staggering to its feet. It roared and charged at Kassandra, who deftly dodged it. The Minotaur crashed into the nearby stonework and slammed its fist into the ground in rage. The Minotaur finally found its balance and stood ready to fight Kassandra in earnest. She drew the [[Spear of Leonidas]] and readied for a difficult battle.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well. The ''mal\u00e1kas'' Minotaur. Aaaand here we go.''\nThe Minotaur swung its axe wildly and charged at Kassandra. She focused on dodging its powerful blows and inflicting hits when it was vulnerable. After she'd damaged him sufficiently, he slammed his fist and axe around and stamped his feet, reducing half of the arena to ruin.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I really need to charge more for slaying mythical creatures...''\nThe Minotaur began using its strikes to scatter debris at Kassandra from range, and the damage to the arena hindered her movements. Despite this, Kassandra eventually wore the Minotaur down and delivered the killing blow.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can't believe... I killed the Minotaur. ''[[Myrrine|Mater]]'' would be so proud.''\nKassandra claimed the [[Atlantis artifact|glowing horn]] from the Minotaur's corpse. As she held it, the horn glowed the same color as her spear and shook violently as it attempted to transmute her like it had its previous holder. Kassandra struggled to resist the power and hold the artifact steady. A ghostly Minotaur behind her reached towards her and the horn.\n*'''Unknown:''' ''...Give us strength, when all of ours is gone...''\nKassandra grit her teeth together and continued to struggle against the artifact. Thanks to her willpower and the [[Hybrid|unique blood]] within her veins, she resisted the artifact's power. It ceased shaking and took its true shape in the form of an [[Apples of Eden|apple]]-like sphere which glowed gently. Kassandra exhaled and pocketed the artifact, not noticing the desiccated corpse of its previous wielder. Then se began the long climb out of the labyrinth.\n\nKassandra returned to the great stone trapdoor to find Ardos waiting for her. Ardos smiled at her, knowing she was successful.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Minotaur is dead. Thanks for your help, Ardos.''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Where's ''pater''?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I searched the labyrinth and\u2014''\n<tabber>\n|-|Nikios' body found=\n{{#tag:tabber|\nHe's dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry, Ardos\u2014''\n*'''Ardos:''' ''Sorry?

    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "If the player says they could not find Nikios, Ardos' closing line, and the Caretaker's if present, will refer to continuing the search for Nikios, even Ardos if was subsequently told to move on and thus accept that he is dead. This indicates that the line for the game to use is flagged by the first dialogue choice rather than the actual outcome. This effect is purely cosmetic, as there is no way to follow up with Ardos afterwards.\n\nIf Ardos is alone and continues the search for Nikios, the hero will say either \"I know you'll find him\" or \"Tyche be with you.\" The exact controlling variable is simply finding his body; if the hero knows the truth and does not tell Ardos, they bid Tyche, goddess of luck, to go with him as they know he'll never actually find Nikios. If the hero does not know the truth, they seem to genuinely believe Ardos will find Nikios somewhere out in the world. The quest also references finding Myrrine, if the main story has advanced that far beforehand, thus allowing the hero to speak from personal experience relative to this progression.\n\nIf Ardos ends up alone, the Caretaker's NPC actor will still spawn at Knossos Palace and begin walking back to Ardos' House anyway.",

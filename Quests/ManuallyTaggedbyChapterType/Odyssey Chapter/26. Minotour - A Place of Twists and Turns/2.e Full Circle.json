    "Section_Dialogue": "*(If players went straight to [[Phaistos Theater]])\n*Kassandra explored Phaistos Theater and saw an old man tied to a post on the dais in the middle of the theater, surrounded by guards of the [[Cult of Kosmos]]. She killed the guards and approached the man.\n**'''Caretaker:''' [[Mercenary|Misthios]],'' help! The Cult is after the boy. I have to save him.''\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''The boy? Ardos?''\n**'''Caretaker:''' ''Yes. How do you\u2014''\n**'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a friend. Hurry up, let's get you out of here.''\n*Kassandra freed the caretaker and led him to safety.\n*(Dialogue continues below at \"Breathe, old man\")\n\n(Standard progression)<br />\nKassandra arrived at Ardos' House northeast of [[Phaistos Village]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be Ardos's House.''\nShe found a young man with color in his beard standing at the door.\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''Where's the boy?! Ardos?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' You're'' his caretaker?''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''Of course! I need to speak with him.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Ardos isn't coming.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry about Ardos. He's safe, far from here.''\nThe \"caretaker\" growled in frustration.\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''Where is he?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was told to expect an old man. You don't look the part.''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''I-it's very important I see him.''\n|-|Lie - I am Ardos.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't you recognize me? Remember all the times we shared? The secrets?''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''Don't take me for a fool!''\n</tabber>\nKassandra grew weary of his obvious ruse and drew her [[Spear of Leonidas|spear]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who told you about the boy? Speak!''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''It's nothing personal with the boy or the old man, but if I tell you anything, I'm good as -''\nKassandra grabbed him by the neck.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dead?<br />Guess what'll happen if you ''don't'' tell me anything?''\nShe released him.\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''OK! What is it you want to know?''\n(Asked \"Where is the old man?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is the old man?''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''They're at Phaistos Village, southwest of here. They got him tied to a post and they're beating him.''\n(Asked \"What do you want with Ardos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is to happen to the boy?''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''I don't know, ''misthios''! They just told me to bring him back!<br />But we both know what they're capable of...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you'd bring them an innocent boy?''\n(Chose \"You're pathetic.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'd stand by as an old man gets beaten -''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''B-but -''\n*'''Kassandra:''' And'' you agreed to kidnap the boy.''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''They're just up the road - the Cult! Go kill them all. You'd be doing me a favor, too.<br />Let me go, and I won't tell anyone what happened.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Attack - You're beyond forgiveness.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You put innocent people in harm's way.<br>You won't get out of this alive.''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''Stay away!''\nThe fake caretaker fled in terror. It is unclear if Kassandra ultimately followed through on killing him.\n|-|You must seek forgiveness.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll let [[Zeus]] decide your fate. I need to find the old man.''\n*'''\"Caretaker\":''' ''Thank you, ''misthios.\nThe fake caretaker knelt down on the stoop as Kassandra took off.\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The old man is alive. I should check the temple in Phaistos.''\nKassandra made her way through the charred ruins of Phaistos Village to the theater, where the Cult of Kosmos had taken up residence.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The old man is here.''\n[[Ikaros]] helped her scout the area and found the old man tied to a post in the middle of the theater.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's the old man amongst those guards.''\nShe killed the Cult guards surrounding the dais and approached the man.\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''I've told you everything I know!<br />W-wait, who are you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ardos sent me. Can you walk?''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''The boy! Thank the gods. Let's get out of here before they return.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a friend. Hurry up, let's get you out of here.''\nKassandra freed the caretaker and led him to safety.\n\nIn the shade of the destroyed buildings far from the theater, the two spoke.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Breathe, old man\u2014''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''Ardos. The boy! Is he safe? Alive?''\n<tabber>\n|-|He's a danger to himself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's made a lot of enemies with his... charm.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''At least he's safe from any danger I may have caused him.''\n|-|I'll keep him safe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't let anyone hurt him.<br>Though I do sometimes think about strangling him myself.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''Ardos has been known to test even the most resolute of wills.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for a way into the [[Labyrinth of Lost Souls|labyrinth]]. Ardos said you might know something.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''I know this\u2014that place is death.''\n(Asked \"What happened in the labyrinth?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What drove everyone out of the labyrinth? Something must have happened.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''I never went inside. I'm not a ''fool''. But [[Nikios]] wanted me to watch the boy.<br />I stayed outside and prayed, but I heard it\u2014the [[Minotaur]]. Two returned, but Nikios...''\n(Asked \"Where is Ardos' father?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ardos says his father is in the labyrinth. Is this true?''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''Yes, he never came out. Though two who did... will never truly escape it.''\n(Asked \"Why won't you talk to Ardos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ardos says you refuse to speak or talk to him about his father.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''How can anyone tell a boy the person he looks up to\u2014his father and only family\u2014is dead?!<br />What I can do in Nikios's honor is to stop his son from entering that cursed place!''\n(Chose \"Tell me what the men want.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would they hurt you?''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''When the survivors fled the Minotaur, they left behind a [[Phaistos Disk|disk]]\u2014the key to the labyrinth... and I kept it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then why do they think Ardos has it?''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''Because he does. He stole it from me. And I told them about it.<br />They tortured me, ''misthios''! I\u2014I tried not to break.<br />I've failed him. I've failed him all these years.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|There's still time to make amends.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people who tortured you belong to a powerful cult. They have broken stronger men than you.<br>You can still make things right with Ardos.<br>As smart as he is, he still needs someone looking out for him\u2014family.<br>He needs you.''\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''He doesn't even want to see me, ''misthios''\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Keep trying.''\nThe caretaker resolved to reunite with Ardos and make amends.\n|-|Stay away from Ardos.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You sold out a small boy and put him in danger!<br>Luckily he's resourceful, smart, and has more backbone than you ever will.''\nThe caretaker sniffled and understood he should never see the boy again.\n</tabber>\nRegardless, the caretaker brought the topic back to the disk.\n*'''Caretaker:''' ''About the disk. He doesn't know its true purpose, ''misthios''. With it, you'll be able to open the labyrinth.<br />Just promise to keep him safe.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'll be safe with me.''\nThe old man left towards his home, while Kassandra was left to ponder her next step.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should ask Ardos if the old man is telling the truth.''\nShe also inspected [[Theseus' Greaves|greaves]] she'd recovered.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be a piece of Theseus' armor. Fancy.''",

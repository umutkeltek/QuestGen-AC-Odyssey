[[Poseidon]] is angry.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you tried making an offering?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''A simple offering isn't enough to appease him! We need to perform a ritual... but we can't do it without our ceremonial axe.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If axe has yet to be found.=\n{{#tag:tabber|\nRituals are important.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like you need to find that axe for Poseidon.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''I do, but not for Poseidon\u2014for [[Swordfish]].''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nUse another axe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There are hundreds of axes around\u2014just use another.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''But the Arkalochori Axe was crafted for this very purpose!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To appease the gods?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''The gods?

It could barely shave a man's beard.''\n:*'''Priestess:''' ''The Arkalochori Axe! Thank the gods. [[Swordfish]] will be pleased. Let me look more closely...''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not so fast.''\n:*'''Priestess:''' ''What do you want, ''misthios''?''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''What I'm owed.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nHere, it's yours.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The axe was yours to begin with.

He runs the [[Fisherman's Beachhead|fish market]]\u2014<br />I can't say any more. No one talks about Swordfish and gets away with it, ''misthios.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What if I insist?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Then ''I'' insist you retrieve the axe for me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' You'' insist?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''N-no! \"''Politely request.\"'' And of course there'll be plenty of [[drachma]]e for your help, ''misthios.\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll do it.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know where the axe is?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Bandits took it!<br />There's a [[Arkalochori Cave|cave]] east of town. If you follow the path along the shoreline, I'm sure you'll find them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go take a look.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''...And don't swing it around! It's a delicate, ceremonial axe!''\nKassandra took her leave and traveled east. She found the Arkalochori Cave with the help of [[Ikaros]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here we are.''\nShe infiltrated the cave, dealt with the bandits, and recovered the axe from the back of the cave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the axe...

No one's seen him for years, ''misthios''. Some think he's dead. Just last week, some fishermen boldly said we should no longer pay fees to a dead man... Guess who's dead now?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take my chances. Where is he?''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''He used to live at [[Fisherman's Beacon]] to the north\u2014you could try your luck there.''\n(\"Where did you say Swordfish was?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Remind me where Swordfish is.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''Try your luck at Fisherman's Beacon to the north\u2014he used to live there.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nAxe not retrieved \u2013 Leave \u2013 \"I have everything I need.\"=\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nAxe retrieved \u2013 \"I found the axe.\"=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This axe would fetch a good price at the agora.''\n*'''Priestess:''' ''No!

    "Section_Trivia": "*Should the player retrieve the axe before talking to the Priestess, there will be no dialogue to find Swordfish.\n*Should\u00a0the player retrieve the axe after talking to the Priestess, there will be\u00a0dialogue pointing to where Swordfish lives, so long as [[Blood in the Water (Odyssey)|Blood in the Water]] is active and the player has not already dove into his sanctuary below the lighthouse.\n*Whether or not the player gets the dialogue to find Swordfish, the \"investigation\" bar for 'Blood in the Water' will automatically fill one-third of the way upon completion of this quest. Completing the investigation is not required to find Swordfish; he is automatically loaded into the world upon completion of [[Myths and Minotaurs]], and 'Blood in the Water' automatically updates upon entering his sanctuary below the lighthouse.\n*The memory also serves as a support quest for the [[Of Minotaurs and Men]] memory.\n*If the axe is kept, it can be equipped as a Rare Heavy Bladed weapon.",

    "Section_Dialogue": "[[Stentor]] took his leave of Kassandra, displeased that Nikolaos wanted to meet her alone at the top of the cliffs. Kassandra made her way there along the dirt road lined with [[Sparta]]n soldiers.\n*'''Spartan Heavy Soldier:''' ''The Wolf awaits you. You fought well today\u2014for a mercenary. Don't keep the Wolf waiting.''\nKassandra gained the top of the trail.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is it... What do I even say...''\nHer mind quickly flashed back in time.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Murderer! She has killed him!''\n*'''[[Myrrine]]:''' ''Kassandra!''\n[[File:ACOD The Wolf of Sparta 3.png|thumb|250px|Nikolaos awaiting Kassandra]]\nWith new found determination, Kassandra walked forward to meet the \"Wolf\".\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''So you are the champion who won the day. Tell me your name, hero, so that I may greet you as a true warrior.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' '' ''Chaire, pater''. It's been a long time.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Impossible. I saw you fall.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't fall, you fucking threw me to my death.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''I did what was required of me as a Spartan. I've made my peace with that. You need to as well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were my father. You were supposed to protect me.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''You were reckless. You forced my hand.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was protecting my brother because ''you'' wouldn't.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''The Oracle decreed that [[Alexios]] had to die. Her word is absolute. You know that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't cower behind your sense of duty anymore...''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Enough! I can't change the past Kassandra... I will live and die a Spartan.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's a large reward for the mercenary that can collect the Wolf's head.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Is that why you're here?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I've come to take my revenge.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Duty won't save you from the ghosts of our past. Now you will answer to me. I'm going to watch the light fade from your eyes as you die by my hand.''\nKassandra pushed Nikolaos, catching him just before he could fall from the edge of the cliff. After a long moment, she let go of him. Nikolaos threw his sword down.\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''I loved you and your brother...''\nKassandra stabbed Nikolaos with the spear.\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''You were never truly mine...''\nKassandra removed the spear as Nikolaos fell to the ground.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''This is something you need to ask your mother. Kassandra... Kassandra... Beware the snakes in the grass...''\nNikolaos expired, and Kassandra fell to her knees as she picked up her father's helm. Stentor arrived and saw Nikolaos dead, then stormed toward Kassandra.\n*'''Stentor:''' ''What's the meaning of this? By all the gods, what have you done?!''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nWhat I came to do.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I came here to get revenge against the man that tried to murder me, and that's what I did.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''Traitor!''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou wouldn't understand.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but he left me no choice. You don't know what happened between us in the past. This was his doing.''\n*'''Stentor:''' ''You and your lies can go straight to fucking Hades!''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nIf players run out of time to answer.=\n*'''Stentor:''' ''I don't need to know why to kill you.''\n}}\nKassandra fought Stentor and defeated him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Spartans will have my head for this. I need to get out of here.''\n|-|I've come to get answers.=\n[[File:ACOD_The_Wolf_of_Sparta_-_Kassandra_Sparing_Nikolaos.png|thumb|250px|Nikolaos spared by Kassandra]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've avoided the past long enough. Now you will answer to me.''\nShe pushed him back, catching him just before he could fall from the edge of the cliff. After a long moment, she threw him to the ground behind her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Though you deserve death, there is no honor in vengeance. You must face the ghosts of your past, ''pater''. And that is a fate worse than death.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''I have failed in my duty. I failed to protect you... to protect both of you. I loved you\u2014and your brother as if you were truly my own. But you were never mine.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''That is a question you should ask your mother.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait\u2014''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Find your mother.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Find her?''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Wherever Myrrine is, she knows far more than I do.''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Wolf_of_Sparta_-_Nikolaos_Abandoning_Position.png|thumb|250px|Nikolas abandoning his post]]\nNikolaos began walking away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where will you go?''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''To find my honor. Beware the [[snake]]s in the grass, Kassandra.''\nKassandra was then left alone atop the cliff, where she picked up Nikolaos' helm.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get out of here. I should head back to [[Barnabas]].''\n</tabber>",

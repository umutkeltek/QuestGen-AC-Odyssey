    "General_Description": "'''A Family's Legacy''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Following the advice of her [[Myrrine|mother]], Kassandra sought out the island of [[Thera]] in order to find her [[Pythagoras|real father]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "As the ''[[Adrestia]]'' neared the coast of Thera, Kassandra admired the site.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This place is nice.''\nThe ship docked and Kassandra stepped onto the ground.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thera. Not what I expected.''\nShe explored the [[Minoan Ruins]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These ruins look old. I wonder who built them and when. What are those towers?''\nWith the help of [[Ikaros]], she scanned the ruins, and found a campsite.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's the camp.''\nInspecting the camp, she found a tablet with instructions.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing but a tablet. I wonder what it says?''\n*'''Ancient Tablet:'''<br>''While continuing my researching on the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] ruins, I found writing that spoke of a doorway. After some translations, it appeared that the reflective mirrors I found are part of a mechanism. I aligned the mirrors, and when I went back into the ruins, I found a path that led deeper underground. At the very bottom of the cave I found an an entrance to somewhere else. Tomorrow, I shall open the door and see what's inside.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, the light beams are the key...''\n[[File:ACOD A Family's Legacy - Lights.jpg|thumb|250px|Mirrors around the ruins]]\nShe made for the light shining off a mirror on the tallest ruin to the south. Fighting off some [[Eurasian lynx|lynxes]], she broke the boards covering a mirror and watched the light bounce west into the ruins.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's aligned!''\nKassandra broke more boards and slid down the rope to follow the light north. She pushed and pulled scaffolding to reflect the light northeast to the building nearest the dock.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks to be in the right position.''\nShe made her way to the building and moved more scaffolding to reflect the light into the hole in the floor.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think I've got it.''\n[[File:ACOD GLC - Kassandra unlocks the entrance.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra at the massive door]]\nShe broke the door below the ruined building and allowed the light to reflect perfectly into the relief above the strange doorway to the south.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There. That should work. Now to try the door.''\nAs she did with the [[Ancient Forge]] on [[Andros]], Kassandra held the [[Spear of Leonidas]] to the entrance. The spear glowed as the entrance gave way, just as before.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Finally. Now, to find what lies within.''\nThe door sealed behind Kassandra. She journeyed deep into the caves beyond the door.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would my father be here?''\nKassandra slid through an opening and reached a magma chamber.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's hot in here.''\nThe footing narrowed as some rocks fell out of the ceiling.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should watch my step.''\nShe crossed to the other side and found a [[Gateway to the Lost City|massive cavern]] at the end of the cave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is this place?''\nShe stared over the edge to find a deep pool of water.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to take a dive.''\nKassandra [[Leap of Faith|leapt]] into the water, pulled herself out, and jogged down the pathway.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This place is huge.''\nAs Kassandra neared the steps leading down, she marveled at some of the [[Isu|strange]] architecture, then spied a man at the bottom.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hello?''\nIkaros flew past her as she descended the stairs.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ikaros!''\nIkaros perched on the man's outstretched arm, as if greeting an old friend.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmpf. Traitor.''\nThe man addressed her directly.\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Greetings, Kassandra. Welcome to [[Atlantis]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Atlantis! Impossible! I thought it was just a myth?''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''There are many secrets in this world that are hidden behind myth and legend.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And who are you?''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''My name is Pythagoras. I'm your father.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pythagoras? That doesn't make sense. He died decades ago.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Yes, almost a century if memory serves. And yet, here I am standing before you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And Ikaros is...''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''My oldest and dearest friend. I sent him to watch over you. And now, here you are.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm seeking my destiny.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've come to fulfil'' [''sic''] ''my destiny.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Oh, you have? And what would that be, young one?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was hoping you'd tell me.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Atlantis doesn't give up its secrets easily.''\n|-|I'm here to meet my father.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've traveled a long way to meet my real father. You.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''You weren't sent here for a family reunion. There are bigger things at stake.''\n|-|Myrrine sent me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Myrrine, my mother\u2014she sent me here to find you.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Myrrine. She sent you here because she knew this was your destiny.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My destiny?''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''There's more at stake than any one mind can comprehend.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why was I sent here? What's my role in all this? I want answers!''\nIkaros took off from Pythagoras's arm.\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''There is knowledge in this place. Powerful knowledge.<br>In the wrong hands, its secrets could bring about the downfall of [[human]]ity.<br>We cannot allow others to discover this place. We must find a way to seal it from the world forever.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't understand any of this. I'm a warrior, not a scholar.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''We all have a purpose, Kassandra. Yours was to help me protect the secrets of Atlantis.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You haven't earned my help.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why should I help you? You were never there for me.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''You endured what you had to in order to be strong enough for what's to come.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I never asked for any of this.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Our destiny is a burden we must shoulder. It is not something we choose.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What would you have me do?''\n|-|We have to seal this place.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right. We must save the [[Greece|Greek]] world from itself.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''Above all things, trust yourself. You're capable of greatness.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do my best.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''The answers I seek are behind these mechanisms. They are sealed, and the [[Atlantis artifact|artifacts]] to open them are missing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So I need to find the artifacts and return them to Atlantis?''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''I've collected information that hints at where these artifacts may be located.<br>However, they are incredibly powerful. They corrupt the minds of lesser people and possess a will to defend themselves.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll bring them back. But I still have questions for you.''\n*'''Pythagoras:''' ''And I have answers. For now, though, take this. It's part of a key to access an artifact that is hidden in [[Boeotia]]. I have an [[Gorgias (historian)|ally]] trying to find the second half as we speak.''",

    "Section_Dialogue": "After Kassandra consulted the [[Pythia]], she knew she had to assassinate Elpenor in order to gather a cloak and mask to infiltrate the [[Cult of Kosmos]]. She made her way to [[Pharsalos Fort]] in the [[Valley of the Nymph]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There he is, hiding in plain sight.''\nKassandra killed a man who looked like Elpenor, only to discover it was a decoy.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A decoy. Why am I not surprised?''\nShe recovered a letter from the body.\n:'''Letter from Elpenor:'''<br/>''Make sure you kill the so-called messenger of the gods this time. I await news of your success in the cave behind the [[Snake Temple|Snake Ruins]] in the [[Valley of the Snake]].<br>\u2013Elpenor''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor, you coward! Elpenor knew I would come for him. Used that imposter to lure me into a trap. Your plan failed, Elpenor. Soon you will join your imposter.''\nEscaping the Fort, she rode on to a cave near the Snake Temple.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Death is coming for you, Elpenor.''\nShe made her way into the cave after dealing with the [[guard]]s.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can smell that ''malaka's'' stench.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''What a shame. We would have made you rich. Before we killed you. Don't take it personally, ''misthios''. Your [[Myrrine|mother]]'s the one we really want. Don't fight it. The Cult always gets what it wants. We already have [[Alexios|Deimos]]. We'll find your mother, and you'll be dead.''\nKassandra struck Elpenor a mortal blow.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Killing me is a mistake.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Trusting you on [[Kephallonia]] was a mistake.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I'm the reason you left that island alive. The Cult wanted you dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What cult? Where are they?''\nElpenor laughed before dying. Kassandra retrieved a [[Artifact Fragment|shard]] which had fallen by his corpse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The small shard I found on Elpenor is like nothing I've ever seen. Might come in handy.''",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra met with Sokrates at the [[Cemetery Road]].\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Behold, I've kept myself alive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was the one job I gave you, Sokrates. I knew you could handle it.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''I would have attempted it even if you hadn't told me to.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's not as easy as it seems\u2014staying alive. There's not many of us left.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Then let's pay tribute to them. Though they aren't here now, they were here once. Come with me.''\nKassandra followed Sokrates and they navigated around the cemetery.\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''My opinion on death is a nebulous one, because I know nothing about it. Therefore, I know I shouldn't be afraid.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not afraid, either.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Many are, because they don't know what death holds for them. One can only trust that the gods know for certain.''\n[[File:ACOD We Remember Memory Screenshot 02.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Sokrates at Phoibe's tombstone]]\nThey arrived at a particular tombstone, belonging to Kassandra's friend [[Phoibe]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phoibe.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She never got to be a little girl. I talked to her like she was already grown up.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Which you did out of respect for her. Question your choices, Kassandra, but never doubt them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you for giving her the burial she deserved.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''There are countless others here, in [[Elysium]]. The blessed have earned that eternal happiness. One of them is our great [[Perikles]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Athens owes him\u00a0a debt for all he's done.''\n*'''Perikles:''' ''They didn't call him the \"first citizen of Athens\" for nothing. A man of many contributions, but also a private man.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I wish I'd known Perikles better.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If only he had shared his burden...''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''We only knew him as he presented himself to be, but who's to say that wasn't his true self?''\n|-|Perikles had his reasons.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He had to keep to himself. He was always being pursued by something or someone.''\n*'''Sokrakes''' ''By protecting himself, he was protecting Athens from ruin. [[Aspasia]] may have been the only one who truly knew him.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This [[Peloponnesian War|war]] has taken so many. Even [[Brasidas]] fell.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Maybe so. But as a [[Sparta]]n, he fulfilled his duty and died on the battlefield.''\n(If Kassandra and Brasidas were on poor terms)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could have helped him more. He was on my side.''\n(If Kassandra and Brasidas were friends \u2013 Determined by choices regarding [[Monger Down|The Monger]] and [[Judge, Jury, Executioner (Odyssey)|Lagos]])\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I helped him all I could. He was my friend.''\nRegardless, Sokrates assured Kassandra of her good works on Brasidas' behalf.\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Your survival avenges him. He will be honored as a hero.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people will remember how we brought down [[Kleon]].''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Apparently soldiers found Kleon on the beach. A casualty of war, perhaps?''\nKassandra shrugged and smiled, barely constructing a lie.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Couldn't say. It's hard to recall what happens in the heat of battle.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Either way, let him spend his eternity in [[Tartaros|Tartarus]] for what he's done. And be certain our friends wait for us in the light.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd drink to that.''\nSokrates paused for a bit, then agreed with a smile.\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Who am I to say no?''\nKassandra invited Sokrates for a drink. They made their way to [[Perikles' Residence]].\n[[File:ACOD We Remember Memory Screenshot 04.png|thumb|250px|A celebration at Perikles' residence]]\nAt the former residence of Athens' leader and their friend, they celebrated alongside [[Aristophanes]], [[Alkibiades]], and [[Hippokrates]]. Aristophanes walked away briefly while Alkibiades, Sokrates, and Kassandra shared a laugh.\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''Well, this has supplied me with plenty of new material for my next play.''\nHippokrates rose from his seat.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|The Monger killed publicly=\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''Remember how Kassandra took [[the Monger]] to task\u2014for all of [[Korinth]] to see! That would suit a drama.''\n|-|The Monger killed secretly=\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''Kassandra killed the Monger as an act of espionage. That's exciting\u2014write a scene like that.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''There's been no love scene yet! Let me provide that inspiration now.''\n\n(If Kassandra romanced [[Xenia]])\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''You want romance? I hear she pursued a pirate queen.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Xenia? Do tell.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My lips are sealed.''\n(If not, Sokrates speaks.)\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Beauty is short-lived. You may as well use it, Alkibiades.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''And to that, I raise my drink.''\nSokrates looked to Kassandra to make a toast.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|To us!=\nKassandra raised her cup.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To us\u2014who have persisted through everything. And to those who wanted to persist.''\n|-|To progress!=\nKassandra raised her cup.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To moving forward. We'll leave the past behind.''\n|-|To Athens!=\nKassandra raised her cup.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To Athens. And our promise to return the city to its former glory.''\n</tabber>\nRegardless, the group raised their cups as well.\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''A tribute as good as your singing.''\nSokrates raised his cup.\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''And to the gods.''\nThe rest besides Alkibiades followed.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Now, dear teacher, I think you should whisk me away for our ''private'' lesson.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''I'm afraid I haven't had enough wine for ''that,'' Alkibiades.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Then someone fill his cup!''\nThey all laughed, and the [[Periklean Circle]] continued talking well into the night.",

    "General_Description": "'''Gluten Free''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra went to look for [[Lagos]]' family after learning they had been kidnapped by the [[Cult of Kosmos]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra infiltrated the nondescript cave under the farm and slew the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]] guards within. In the depths of the cave, she found a woman and child, [[Philonoe]] and [[Niloxenos]], locked in cages. She released and spoke to them as the two tearfully embraced. Philonoe released the child and turned her attention to Kassandra.\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''Who are you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kassandra. [[Brasidas]] sent me.''\n*'''Niloxenos:''' ''Are we going home?''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''I have no idea.''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''We've been trapped in this filthy cave for days with no word from [[Lagos]] whatsoever.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're free, but it's not safe to return to Lagos, yet.''\n*'''Niloxenos:''' ''Are those scary men still with ''pater''?''\n(If players asked \"What have you heard about the Cult of Kosmos?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you heard of the Cult of Kosmos?''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''Only in whispers... Ever since my husband found new \"business partners,\" they've stationed guards around our home. For our safety, he said. Then one day, those guards dragged us here.''\n(Leave - \"I'll deal with the scary men.\")<br>\n[[File:ACOD Gluten Free 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra speaking to Niloxenos]]\nKassandra knelt down and smiled at Niloxenos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're making your ''pater'' do things he doesn't want to do.''\nShe stood and turned to Philonoe, while still addressing the child.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find Lagos and release him from these scary men.''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''And what of us? I can't go back to that wretch, and now that these guards are dead, we're in danger.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For now, go to my friend, Brasidas. He'll meet you at the safe house northeast of Tegea.''\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''Where Lagos has his secret meetings...''\nShe remained skeptical of the whole turn of events. Niloxenos turned to her.\n*'''Niloxenos:''' ''Are you angry, ''mater''?''\nPhilonoe composed herself.\n*'''Philonoe:''' ''I am grateful you saved us. We'll go find Brasidas. Chaire.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra rescued Lagos' family and removed the Cult's leverage over him. This gave him the option to abandon the Cult altogether.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Completing this quest reduces Lagos' persistent bounty, presumably as a result of him learning Kassandra rescued his family, but maintaining it just enough to placate the Cult.  Together with [[Breaking Bread]] and [[Fourth-Degree Burns]], this can remove up to two of the three helmets before dealing with Lagos and lifting the bounty altogether.",

I'll transcribe them when I have time \u2014 or when the [[Peloponnesian War|war]] subsides.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you'll have to come with me.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra brought Dymas to reconstitute Hippokrates' notes, and in turn the doctor pointed her in the direction of one who could help her find her mother.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*There are four ways to get Dymas to help Hippokrates:\n**The first is to help him with his surgery first. Hippokrates' patient will die from the delay, and Dymas will apologize for causing the delay. Hippokrates responds that \"Sometimes science requires tough decisions.\" This is the only method that will remove the Bone Forceps quest item, as that item will persist in either the chest or in the player's inventory.\n**The second is to bribe Dymas. This requires 10,000 drachmae and leaves Dymas' patient to die, which Dymas simply does not mention to Hippokrates. The player has the option of encouraging this ruse or dressing down his monetary demand in front of Hippokrates. Regardless, Dymas is able to save Hippokrates' patient.\n**The third is to threaten Dymas and knock him out cold. This avoids the payment but adds the burden of having to carry the unconscious Dymas out of Fort Tiryns and back to Hippokrates. He later tells Hippokrates what the player did, to which Hippokrates replies that Dymas' patient did not deserve their fate.\n**The fourth is to execute the patient. This has the same outcome as the third, as Dymas yells for help and is knocked out. He later tells Hippokrates that the player murdered his patient. Hippokrates is shocked, replies that \"We should not decide who lives and who dies\", and apologizes to Dymas.\n*If the quest is completed after [[Speak No Evil]], the delay causes Hippokrates' patient to die no matter what. The blame is placed wholly on Kassandra as she takes full responsibility, although if Dymas is bribed, she can mention that it cost her a fortune to get Dymas to leave the fort.\n*Completing this quest before Speak No Evil results in Hippokrates telling the player to go to the Sanctuary of Asklepios and tell an elder priest that a cure for the Sacred Disease will soon be ready, implying that this will get them to talk. Unfortunately, no such option actually exists in the game and the player must complete, at the very least, [[A Heart for a Head]] and Speak No Evil, as though they had gone to the Sanctuary first. However, instead of rubbing their necks indecisively, [[Mydon]] and his servant will tell Kassandra about the [[Altar of Apollo Maleatas]].\n*Completing this quest after Speak No Evil is the only way to get [[A Herald of Murder]] to become available. Hippokrates will not mention [[Dolops]] at all if Mydon has not been spoken to.\n*In most of the dialogues, Hippokrates is well aware of who Dymas is, however he will ask who he is when bringing him unwillingly and prior to Speak No Evil.\n*The notes referenced throughout the quest are what would become a piece known as {{Wiki|On the Sacred Disease}}, one of the first recorded observations of epilepsy, the Sacred Disease, in humans.",

    "General_Description": "'''A Heart for a Head''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "In order to gain information on the movements of her [[Myrrine|mother]], Kassandra was tasked by a [[Priests of Asklepios|priest]] of [[Asklepios]] to bring in a suitable sacrifice to save the sick.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way to [[Mount Koryphum]] to locate and subdue the white [[Cattle|bull]]. [[Bandit]]s ranged the ruins, and it seemed they had gotten to the bull first, for it lay dead within their camp in the [[Asine Ruins]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The white bull. Am I too late?''\nKassandra snuck her way into the camp, retrieving what she could from the carcass.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Doesn't look like he died \"willingly.\" I'll take his heart for the sacrifice\u2014it'll have to do.<br>Ugh. Not the best feeling.<br>I hope the heart is enough. If they want the whole bull, they can come get it themselves.''\nShe snuck away, then returned to the [[Sanctuary of Asklepios]].\n*'''Priest:''' ''Did you find the white bull?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I couldn't bring it back alive, but I did manage to collect its heart.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''This won't be enough to please Asklepios. The beast died unwillingly, and with just the heart, we'll only be able to pray for one life.''\nPatients began approaching.\n*'''[[Eteokles (Argolian)|Farmer]]:''' ''Please, ''misthios''. The white bull you killed was mine. My farm feeds half of [[Argolis]]. If I die, people will starve.''\n*'''Wealthy woman:''' ''I beg you! My husband was killed by the [[Plague of Athens|sickness]]. I have two small children. Who will take care of them if I die? I am wealthy, and will pay you for this blessing.''\n*'''Child:''' ''It's OK, give the sacrifice to them.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''You did this. You choose whose prayers get heard by the gods.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|The farmer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pray for the farmer. The bull was his, its sacrifice will help feed the people of Argolis.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Very well.''\nThe wealthy woman turned away, forlorn.\n|-|The wealthy woman.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pray for this woman. The world has too many orphans already.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Gods bless you, ''misthios''! My children thank you.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''You'll pay for this!''\nThe farmer turned away, angry.\n*'''Priest:''' ''It will be done.''\n|-|The girl.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know what it's like to be small and forsaken. Pray for the girl.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''You'll regret this!''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Not an easy choice, ''misthios''. But it's been made.''\nThe wealthy mother cried and turned away.\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Priest:''' ''The rest is in the hands of the gods.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did my part, priest.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''This [[Sparta]]n woman you're after...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've met her?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Her visit to the sanctuary is legendary, but sadly it was before my time. The man you want is [[Mydon]] the Elder Priest. He spoke of her often. That is, before he cut out his tongue.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Cut out his tongue?''\n*'''Priest:''' ''When he's not healing the sick he's in the [[Guesthouse, Argolis|guesthouse]]. Spends a lot of his time being... tended to by servants.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you. I won't forget you helped me.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''And these people won't forget you helped them.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped the priest with sickness issue and learned the name and location of Mydon, an elder priest who met her mother.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "This is the only quest in the Sanctuary of Asklepios that actually advances the main quest. [[Timoxenos]] gives the player the Spartan baby blanket in which Myrrine wrapped her injured [[Alexios|baby]] but can't help them any further than that, and [[Pylenor]] doesn't actually know anything useful.\n\nThe choice in this quest determines a later impact quest. If the farmer is chosen, [[Falling on Deaf Ears]] becomes available.",

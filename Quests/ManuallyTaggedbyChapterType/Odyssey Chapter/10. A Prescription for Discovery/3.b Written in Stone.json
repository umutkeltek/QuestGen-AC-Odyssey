    "General_Description": "'''Written in Stone''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra agreed to follow a [[Timoxenos|scribe]] to learn what had happened to her [[Myrrine|mother]] and [[Alexios|brother]] all those years ago.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra met with Timoxenos.\n* '''Timoxenos:''' ''Greetings, young one. Come to offer [[Asklepios]] a sacrifice?''\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''No, but I'm searching for a [[Sparta]]n mother who may have.''\n* '''Timoxenos:''' ''The great [[Greek mythology|goddess]] [[Juno|Hera]] guides many mothers to this sacred place. Surely I'm too feeble to remember them all.''\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''What are these stone slabs for?''\n* '''Timoxenos:''' ''These are records. We document all who pass through\u2014their illnesses, treatments\u2014so that the glory of Asklepios can be celebrated.''\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''Then I don't need your memory. I just need to find the right stone.''\n'''Timoxenos:''' ''Um, yes, of course. That's very wise, indeed. If only I had the time to help you...''\n<tabber>\n|-|I won't hurt you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Listen, I'm not here to hurt you. I'm just looking for my ''mater''.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''It's Chrysis. She's got every priest in the sanctuary under her thumb, and she'll squash anyone who feeds information to the Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then don't tell me anything\u2014just bring me to the stone that can.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Follow me, then. Quickly, we must be discreet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lead the way.''\n|-|\ud83d\udd9d I will hurt you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My mother came through here, and unless you want me to paint these stones with your blood, you'll tell me what you know.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Please... It's Chrysis. She said that anyone who talks to the Eagle Bearer will be paying a visit to [[Underworld|Hades]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then don't talk. Just bring me to the stone that can.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Follow me, then. Quickly, we must be discreet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lead the way.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra followed Timoxenos to where she hoped would be stone engravings about her mother.\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''This way. Over here. If anyone is watching, they'll have my head.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What kind of sanctuary isn't safe for its priests?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Times have changed, Eagle Bearer.''\nThey arrived at the tablets.\n[[File:ACOD Written in Stone - Kassandra with Timoxenos.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra with Timoxenos at the first slab]]\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Ah! I remember this tale. Written during the time of the great Helot Revolt. You would have been only a child.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need the history, just the details.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''It tells the tale of a woman with worms in her throat. Asklepios took off her head so we could remove them, then reattached it in her sleep.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Definitely not the right one. I wonder what [[Hippokrates]] would think of these... treatments.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Hippokrates is a fine healer. Showed so much promise.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Showed? He's healing the sick right now.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''He puts too much faith in his hands, and not enough in the gods.''\n*'''Kassandra:''': ''When it comes to life and death, I prefer hands. Are all the testimonies so... outrageous?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Writers today\u2014[[Thucydides]], [[Euripides]], the petulant [[Aristophanes]]... All of them try for realism, but\u2014what really inspires is greatness, magic, gods!''\nNear the [[Guesthouse, Argolis|guesthouse]] they found another slab.\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''This one tells the tale of a man with sword wounds. A pack of [[dog]]s licked him clean, and eureka! A man's best friend indeed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is hopeless.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''These stories ''give'' people hope, Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I'm losing mine. Tell me about Chrysis.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''A very powerful, dangerous woman. But it was not always so. She was abandoned here as a child and taken in by the priests. Taught the ways of the gods. She learned very quickly, was very strong-willed, and before too long it was the priests who listened to her. She was loved. But there's an anger in her heart that could not be soothed. So when her methods turned to madness, anyone who opposed her got...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got what?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''I've already said too much.''\nThey reached yet another slab.\n[[File:ACOD Written in Stone - Final Slab.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Timoxenos at the last slab]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what about this one? Let me guess: it tells the tale of a blind woman who had her eyes licked by [[snake]]s.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''It reads \"Of Sparta. Came here with child. Sought pity from the gods.\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why is most of it scratched out?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Oh, I um... I'll just tell you. I know this one by heart. The Spartan woman arrived filthy and bleeding from her travels. We cared for her, gave her food, a bath, and she left. Where she went, I do not know. The child... could not be saved.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who does know where she went?''\nTimoxenos noticed another priest watching them.\n[[File:ACOD Written in Stone - Pleistos Arrived.png|thumb|250px|Pleistos interrupting Kassandra and Timoxenos]]\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''We've been spotted. Meet me later, near the [[Olive Tree of Herakles]] at the entrance of the sanctuary. I may have something for you.''\nThe man approached them.\n*'''Priest:''' ''And what do we have here, a priest and a mercenary out for a friendly stroll?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''May the gods be with you, [[Pleistos]]! I was just on my way to the archives when this ''misthios'' bumped into me.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Is that so? And what were you both chatting about so fervently, might I ask?''\n<tabber>\n|-|We were talking about my mother.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for my mother, a Spartan woman who came through here. This kind of priest brought me to this stone\u2014it could be hers.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''I um, have to... There's something\u2014I must be going.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''We treat the sick, Eagle Bearer, and we respect the privacy of those we've treated. Now please leave. Your presence can only cause harm.''\nPleistos left. Kassandra proceeded to leave town, making her way to the Olive Tree of [[Herakles]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The tree of Herakles... I'm not sure if it's loved more for its legend or its [[olive]]s. Now, where's that priest?''\nKassandra arrived, only to discover Timoxenos's lifeless body.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happened? Who did this?''\n[[File:ACOD Written in Stone - Timoxenos Dead.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding Timoxenos' body]]\nAs she stepped forward to investigate, Kassandra was interrupted by Pleistos accompanied by guards loyal to the [[Cult of Kosmos]].\n*'''Priest:''' ''He knew the penalty for speaking with the Eagle Bearer about... her. Chrysis was clear.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You didn't have to kill him.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''But we did... and now we'll kill you.''\nKassandra fought and eliminated Pleistos and his guards.\n|-|We were talking about sword wounds.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The good priest here was teaching me how to heal sword wounds.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Erm, yes... sword wounds...''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Oh really? And what is the treatment for sword wounds according to Timoxenos here?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nSnakes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Um... snakes. You wrap snakes around the wound to stop the bleeding.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Ooh! A most ingenious treatment wouldn't you say, Timoxenos?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''I um, have to... There's something\u2014I must be going.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''We treat the sick, Eagle Bearer, and we respect the privacy of those we've treated. Now please leave. Your presence can only cause harm.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nOlives.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Um... olives. You stuff the wounds with olives\u2014prevents bleeding.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Olives, that's a new one. Most impressive, Timoxenos.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''I um, have to... There's something\u2014I must be going.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''We treat the sick, Eagle Bearer, and we respect the privacy of those we've treated. Now please leave. Your presence can only cause harm.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nDogs.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dogs.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''What about them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You use the dogs to lick the wounds clean.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''Very good! Don't give away all our tricks, Timoxenos. Who will bring offerings to the gods when our patients learn to heal themselves?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''No, no, of course not. Now if you'll excuse me, I have matters to attend to.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''You have your treatment, ''misthios''. Now please leave the sanctuary.''\n}}\nPleistos left. Kassandra proceeded to leave town, making her way to the Olive Tree of Herakles.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The tree of Herakles... I'm not sure if it's loved more for its legend or its [[olive]]s. Now, where's that priest?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''I thank you for your discretion, Eagle Bearer. Chrysis has many eyes and ears throughout the sanctuary.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What else can you tell me about the Spartan woman and child?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''The woman left the child's blanket behind. We tried to return it, but it was too painful a memory for her.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where did she go? What happened to the child?''\n[[File:Written in Stone - Assassin's Creed Odyssey.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Timoxenos confronted by Pleistos and a Cultist guard]]\nTheir meeting was interrupted by Pleistos accompanied by guards loyal to the Cult of Kosmos.\n*'''Priest:''' ''So, Chrysis was right. You knew the rules, Timoxenos. You will suffer her wrath.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Pleistos, please!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get behind me, priest. I'll deal with these two.''\nTimoxenos fled while Kassandra defeated and killed Pleistos and the Cultist guards.\n|-|\u2696\ufe0f I was looking for the bath house.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm filthy and could use a good bath. The kind priest here was pointing me in the direction of the bath house.''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''Erm, yes... that's correct. The bath house is right over there. Now if you'll excuse me.''\n*'''Priest:''' ''The baths are for healing the sick, not for washing the blood off one's hands. Leave.''\nPleistos left. Kassandra proceeded to leave town, making her way to the Olive Tree of Herakles.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The tree of Herakles... I'm not sure if it's loved more for its legend or its [[olive]]s. Now, where's that priest?''\n*'''Timoxenos:''' ''I thank you for your discretion, Eagle Bearer.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra learned about her mother and brother, and recovered Alexios' baby blanket from Timoxenos.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Lying to Pleistos, or correctly answering \"Dogs\" when he quizzes the player on sword wounds according to Timoxenos, is the only way to keep him alive. Telling the truth or giving an incorrect answer tips him off and results in Timoxenos's immediate death. Pleistos says, \"We treat the sick...\" in response to all three \"incorrect\" dialogue choices.\n*This quest is not actually required to track down Chrysis, and in fact is available for some time after her death as well. All dialogue assumes she is still alive and has the sanctuary under her thumb.\n*Pleistos can be knocked out and recruited as a lieutenant for the Adrestia with a unique avatar. If that is the case, he is the only Cult of Kosmos member with a unique avatar that is named, as the other three Cult of Kosmos members with unique avatars are not named. The vanguard without a mask can also be knocked out and recruited as a lieutenant, though in the Ship menu, he will simply be called \"Cultist\".",

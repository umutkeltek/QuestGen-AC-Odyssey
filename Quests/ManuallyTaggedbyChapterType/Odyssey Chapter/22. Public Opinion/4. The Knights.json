With that and the proof you presented at the [[Pnyx]], Kleon has lost much of his popularity.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Now he heads to [[Amphipolis]] in an effort to redeem himself.''\n[[File:ACOD The Knights 2.png|thumb|250px|A messenger asking Kassandra to meet Brasidas]]\nA man rushed into the room.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Kassandra! [[Brasidas]] sent me to find you. He's alive and well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is he now?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Amphipolis. They're preparing for [[Battle of Amphipolis|battle]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you reach him before I do, tell him I'm on the way.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''So what are you going to do?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm going to kill Kleon.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kleon dies now. This is our chance.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''The plan is already working. Death shouldn't be brought early, even to someone like Kleon.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's ''exactly'' the type death should come early to. Not all who live deserve to grow old, Sokrates.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''And you decide who deserves it?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This time I do.''\nSokrates sighed as Kassandra prepared to leave the room.\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Then safe travels.''\n|-|I'm going to help Brasidas.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Brasidas needs my help. I plan on giving it to him. Though should our paths cross, I won't hesitate to kill Kleon.''\nKassandra prepared to leave.\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Whatever you decide, remember he is only a man.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't promise anything.''\n*'''Sokrates:''' ''Be safe.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra left.",

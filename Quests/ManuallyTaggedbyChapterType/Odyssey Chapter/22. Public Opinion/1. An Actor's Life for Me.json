    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra spoke to Aristophanes in [[Perikles' Residence]].\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''It'll be a disaster, a disaster I tell you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Calm down. What are you talking about?''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''My masterpiece! it will change everything\u2014amuse, astound, titillate, and open people's eyes to Kleon's machinations! But I need you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm no\u00a0actor or poet, Aristophanes.''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''By the gods, no! it's Thespis. My leading man is missing! A play with no star is no play at all.''\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me 1.png|thumb|250px|Aristophanes speaking to Kassandra]]\n(If players asked \"What happened?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How do you know he's missing?''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''He never misses a rehearsal... unless he's drunk, or with a woman... or a man.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Could be anything, then?''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''No, he knows how important this is. He wouldn't let me down... Something must be wrong!''\n(If players asked \"Why is Thespis special?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You could just get another actor.''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''Oh, no. Thespis always draws a huge crowd for his performances.<br />The more people who experience my blistering indictment of Kleon, the better.''\n(If players chose \"Tell me where you think Thespis is.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where would I find him?''\n*'''Aristophanes:''' ''Thespis usually doesn't go far from his home. You'd best start there.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll fetch Thespis.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This shouldn't take long. Prepare the show, and I'll be back as soon as I find him.''\nKassandra travelled to the [[Agora of Athens]]. [[Ikaros]] helped her identify the actor's house.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be Thespis' house.''\nShe approached the house but only found an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Bulis|soldier]]. She overheard him as he rifled through Thespis' belongings.\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Come on, come on. It's got to be here!''\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra interrogating Bulis]]\nKassandra stepped inside, quickly disarmed the soldier, and held him at spearpoint.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't look like an actor, unless you're playing an Athenian [[guard]].''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''I\u2014I...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hush. I'm going to ask some questions, and you're going to answer.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''But Commander [[Rhexenor]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's your name?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Bulis.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well Bulis, it's your choice whether you walk out of here. Do you understand?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Yes.''\n(If players asked \"What are you doing?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me, what are you looking for?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Some stupid play. They don't tell me anything.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Play?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''I just do what I'm told, and they told me to destroy the manuscript.''\n(If players asked \"Where's Thespis?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What have you done with Thespis?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Some of the boys are meant to keep him drunk in the [[Tavern, Athens|tavern]] down the street.''\n(If players chose \"You must know more.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'd better be telling me everything.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''All I know is they wanted to keep this actor busy. See for yourself\u2014he's at the tavern.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're sure that's all?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''I just follow the Commander's orders. I don't ask questions.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You should die.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry, but you can't be trusted to live.''\nKassandra fought and slew Bulis.\n|-|Join me.=\nKassandra freed the guard.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do something worthwhile and join my crew. You're loyal, and you follow orders.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''You'd take me?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you say?''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''To get away from Athens... Thank you, thank you.''\nBulis promptly left and later joined the crew of the ''[[Adrestia]].''\n|-|Don't let me see you again.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get out of here, and count yourself lucky.''\n*'''Athenian Guard:''' ''Thank you, thank you...''\nBulis ran off.\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra travelled to the tavern, finding a drunk Thespis surrounded by a group of Athenian guards.\n*'''Thespis:''' ''...And then I saids to him, if this is your wife, why did she charge me?!<br />I'd loves to stay, but my cup's drained, and I'm to perform tomorrow.''\nThe [[Andras|brute]] leading the soldiers bid him to stay, as per his orders.\n*'''Andras:''' ''Another drink! Come, one more tale. The night is young...''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think he's had enough.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''And what business is it of yours, ''friend''?''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Yeah, was business... Oh, look at you!''\n*'''Andras:''' ''You'd best be leaving.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Not without Thespis.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here for his employer, Aristophanes.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''So? He's not working now.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Yes! I's not working... I like him though. Aristophanes, funny man... buts opinions. Told him it's dangerous.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''That it is.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need him sober and rested.''\n|-|I don't want any trouble.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm just here for Thespis. He's drunk, and I need to get him home.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''What are you, his mater?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's say extended family.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me Memory 6.png|thumb|250px|Soldiers gathering behind Andras]]\nAthenian soldiers gathered behind Andras.\n*'''Andras:''' ''I don't think you understand the situation. Commander Rhexenor's orders are he's not to leave.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''I saids I'd stay... Don't want trouble.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Threaten \u2013 Go back to your goat pen.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go take your boys somewhere else.''\nKassandra punched Andras, knocking him back, but his men caught him and uprighted him. He cracked his knuckles menacingly.\n*'''Andras:''' ''You'll regret that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get going\u2014from your smell, you already know where the [[goat]] pens are. I'm sure they miss you.''\nAndras and his guards began to walk away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''(Maaa!)''\nAndras snapped and turned back to attack Kassandra with his guards. She slew them and returned her attention to Thespis.\n|-|Get out of here!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you don't want to leave with your heads stuffed up your asses, you'll go now.''\nAndras stood up.\n*'''Andras:''' ''We'll be seeing you, misthios. The Commander's not a man to be messed with.''\nAndras and his guards left, vowing to return later.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'd mess yours up, but...=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No need for jealousy, just because your mother was a goat. Like mother, like kid.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''You need to die!''\nKassandra eliminated Andras and the soldiers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I sometimes wonder if leaving [[Kephallonia]] was a good idea.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLet's work this out.=\n}}\n|-|Let's make a deal.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give me Thespis, and I'll give you something in return. I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll pay you a lot. [600]=\nKassandra took out a pouch of [[drachma]]e and threw it on the table.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, for your troubles. I'll look after him now.''\nAndras picked up the pouch and weighed it satisfactorily.\n*'''Andras:''' ''Huh, a fool and his drachmae... Very well, you won't see us again.''\nAndras and his guards left.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI'll pay you a little. [300]=\nKassandra took out a pouch of [[drachma]]e and threw it on the table.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Take this and get out of my sight.''\nAndras was offended at the paltry sum and stood up.\n*'''Andras:''' ''Do you think we're farmers that can be bought for beans? Take your money and stick it up your ass.''\n*'''Andras:''' ''We'll be seeing you, misthios. The Commander's not a man to be messed with.''\nAndras and his guards left, vowing to return later.\n}}\n</tabber>\nThespis got up from his seat and promptly collapsed on the ground.\n*'''Thespis:''' ''I's not feeling too good...''\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me Memory 8.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra carrying Thespis home]]\nKassandra carried Thespis on her back, travelling to his home.\n*'''Thespis:''' ''He said you're behind a mask\u2014you'll be perfectly safe, he saids...<br />You's sooo strong, [[Aikaterine]].<br />Wheee, giddy ups!<br />My parents said you'll be either an actor or a drunk... Ha, fooled them. I becames both!<br />Told him, Kleon will kill us all. It's more assaults than satire!<br />The sausage seller was ''my'' idea!<br />Then I will... I will... gather my... what was it again? Oh yes... sausages!<br />Mmm... sausages...<br />Let me tell you a secret... It's a good one... I uh... I forget.<br />Listen to me... I love you. I do.''\nKassandra reached Thespis' home, putting him on the ground.\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Thank you, but you can go no further... For I know true love!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I just need you ready to perform tomorrow.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Of course, and I just need my [[Muses|muse]]... My love! I can't, I ''won't'' perform without her.''\n(If players asked \"Why won't you perform?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You will perform.''\n[[File:ACOD An Actor's Life for Me 9.png|thumb|250px|Thespis calling out for Aikaterine]]\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Uh-uh, not with out Aikaterine, a divine name for a divine body... I mean being.''\n(If players asked \"Who were those men?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those men in the tavern... Who were they?''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Oh, the admirers. Harmless really... And I do like a man in uniform.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Pull yourself together.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You need to sober up. This play's important.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''So's Aikaterine! I need my muse.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Please? She's just west of here at the [[House of Aphrodite]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it means you'll do the play, I'll find your muse.''\n\n:(If Andras was not fought and defeated at the tavern or given the large sum of drachma)\n:Kassandra left the house to find Andras and his men surrounding her.\n:*'''Andras:''' ''Going to enjoy this.

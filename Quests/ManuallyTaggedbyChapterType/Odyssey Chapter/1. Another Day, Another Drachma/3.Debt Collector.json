    "General_Description": "'''Debt Collector''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2020 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra sought to collect [[Markos]]' debt to her from the [[merchant]] [[Duris]]. However, she had to save [[Phoibe]] first, who had been kidnapped by the [[Cyclops of Kephallonia|Cyclops]]' thugs.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra rode down to [[Ktimene Beach]] where the kidnappers had taken [[Phoibe]],\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There they are. I'll sneak up on the ''malákes''.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Lemme go!''\n*'''Rogue:''' ''Shut it, or I'll tighten those ropes!''\n*'''Brute:''' ''She'll make good ransom [[drachma]]e for the Cyclops.''\n[[File:Debt Collector - Phoibe kidnapped - Assassins Creed Odyssey.png|thumb|250px|Phoibe and the kidnappers]]\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''No one's gonna buy me from you. They're all poor.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Keep quiet, Phoibe...'' ''This tall grass will keep me hidden.''\nKassandra killed an approaching [[bandit]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can't let the rest of those ''malákes'' get away.''\nAfter killing the remaining bandits, Kassandra freed Phoibe.\n[[File:ACOD_Debt_Collector - Kassandra Checking Phoibe.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra checking on Phoibe]]\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Kassandra! I'm here! Untie me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you all right?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''It wasn't so bad. Last time, they put a cloth in my mouth so I'd stop biting.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phoibe, just... be careful. You're alone now, since—''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Since my parents died? I'm OK, I've got you! And you've got me and Markos. We're your family, right?''\nAt this statement, Kassandra drifted back in time to a memory involving [[Nikolaos]] and training.\n[[File:Debt Collector - Kassandra training - Assassins Creed Odyssey.png|thumb|250px|Myrrine watching a young Kassandra training]]\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''You'll have to be stronger than that!''\n*'''[[Myrrine]]:''' ''Don't give in! Let him have it!''\nMyrrine then knocked Kassandra down from behind with her staff.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Got you!''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Again! Up!''\n*'''Young Kassandra:''' ''Yes, ''Pater''.''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''A [[Sparta]]n rises as soon as they've fallen. Ready your staff. Widen your stance. A [[soldier]] grounds themselves. Good, good. Approach me.''\nKassandra screamed right before attacking.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''That's enough, Nikolaos. The [[sun]]'s going down. Time to eat—don't you think?''\nNikolaos waved Kassandra off, so Kassandra approached Myrinne and her baby.\n*'''Young Kassandra:''' ''What are we eating tonight?''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Tonight we are having baby [[Alexios]]. And what a feast he will be!''\n*'''Young Kassandra:''' ''No, not him! Take me instead, I'm tasty!''\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''Yes, yes, you're all sweet as [[honey]], now, come inside. The [[Sheep|lamb]]'s turning black!''\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Here. Lay him in his bed.''\n[[File:ACOD Debt Collector - Nikolaos And Kassandra.png|thumb|250px|Nikolaos with Kassandra]]\nNikolaos handed Alexios to Kassandra.\n*'''Young Kassandra:''' ''Yes, ''Pater''.''\nAs Kassandra prepared to go into the house, Nikolaos called out to her.\n*'''Nikolaos:''' ''Kassandra. You are my greatest pride. Remember that. You'll bring this family to glory. Go.''\nKassandra returned to the present.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You worry too much.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't worry ''enough''.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''We'll be all right if we watch out for each other. Which reminds me! The thugs said ''you'' should watch your back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What'd they say?''\n[[File:ACOD_Debt Collector - Kassandra And Phoibe Parted Ways.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Phoibe parted ways]]\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''They said the Cyclops put a ''big'' [[Bounty hunter|bounty]] on you. [[Talos the Stone-Fist]] wants you dead.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Talos the [[mercenary]]? Am I ever not in trouble?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Better get him before he gets you. I hear he's really mean. I'll find my way back to town. ''Chaire''!''\nPhoibe ran off.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Talos the Stone-Fist? That's just what I need today. ''Another'' broken nose. I'm going to have to take care of that.''\nKassandra continued on, riding [[Phobos]] to [[Sami]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sami. [[Duris]] will be at his shop.''\nKassandra arrived in Sami, finding Duris at his shop.\n*'''Duris:''' ''Get your pots here! Good for the whole family!''\n[[File:ACOD Debt Collector - Kassandra Confronting Duris.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra confronting Duris]]\nKassandra approached Duris.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hello, Duris. Business looks good.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''Tell Markos to come down here himself if he wants his money.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But I'm here now.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''Look, I was a little late paying. Now Markos says I owe him double because of interest. I don't have it to spare!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Then you shouldn't have borrowed the money.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You should have thought of that when you borrowed the drachmae, Duris.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''But, my family—''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's hot. I'm in a bad mood, and you're going to pay. We both know it. The question is, what do I break first—you or your merchandise.''\n|-|You're right. Double is too much.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Double? That's robbery.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''That's what I told Markos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know him, he's... extreme. If you pay him, this will all be over with.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Duris:''' ''You tell Markos I've paid enough already! I won't bow to—to—to a mercenary! Or to someone foolish enough to borrow money from the Cyclops.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''From the Cyclops? That's how he bought his vineyard?''\n*'''Duris:''' ''Look, I know you'd be dead without Markos—what with him taking you off the street as a kid. But you know what he's doing is crazy!''\n<tabber>\n|-|I won't leave without the drachmae.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' Maláka''! Still, that doesn't change the drachmae you owe.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''Face it—once the Cyclops gets hold of you, you'll both be dead!''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nIf Kassandra choose to break Duris' wares.=\n*'''Duris:''' ''All right, all right! I'll pay you! Just stop! Fine! The money is yours. Just leave!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pleasure doing business with you, Duris.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''Keep my name off your lips! I don't want the Cyclops coming after me for the debt you can't pay.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nIf Kassandra choose to kill Duris=\nKassandra attacked Duris.\n*'''Duris:''' ''Ah, that hurts! Stop, I'll pay you, stop!''\nDuris handed over the drachmae.\n}}\n|-|I'll leave you alone now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right about that. Forget the drachmae. Markos and I need to have a little talk.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''You're letting me go? Then at least take this [[Duris' Sword|sword]]. Nothing special, but it's better than that rusty one you've got.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With the Cyclops involved, I'll need it.''\n*'''Duris:''' ''You better set Markos straight. Or you're both dead!''\n</tabber>\n[[File:Debt Collector - Markos threatened - Assassins Creed Odyssey.png|thumb|250px|A bandit with Markos]]\nKassandra made the trip to the [[Temple of Zeus, Kephallonia|Temple]] of [[Jupiter|Zeus]], just in time to overhear a conversation between one of the Cyclops's thugs and Markos.\n*'''Brute:''' ''You're running out of time until the Cyclops comes for you, ''maláka''. He wants his ''money''.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Could I have an extension?''\n*'''Brute:''' ''When he sails back to [[Kephallonia]], he'll come and ''break'' you as soon as he docks. ''If'' you don't get it.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Now, let's be civil—''\n*'''Brute:''' ''You can't hide behind your glorious ''misthios'' forever, Markos. He'll kill ''you'', the mercenary, ''and'' that little runt girl that hangs around.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Of course! Not a problem! I-I'll get the drachmae!''\n*'''Brute:''' ''Good. Or I'll come and watch the Cyclops feed you to his [[goat]]s.''\nKassandra walked up just as the thug departed.\n*'''Markos:''' ''Ah, Kassandra! I-I can tell from the smile on your face Duris has paid you your drachmae.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who's smiling? I just heard where you got your drachmae for the vineyard. Are you out of your fucking mind?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''We can get the money back! C-Can't we? I'm sure it's possible!''\n<tabber>\n|-|It's impossible.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've made an idiotic promise, Markos. One we can't keep.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''I thought you were invincible.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe I am. But you're not.''\n|-|We can try.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will take a ''lot'' of work. And even then I'm not sure.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''We have no option but to try!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then ''you'd'' better be willing to help. I won't do all the dirty work.''\n|-|We'll get the drachmae.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We have no other choice now. We need a plan.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''That's what I do best!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This'll take more than your usual tricks up your sleeve.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Markos:''' ''I long for the old days! Remember them? They were simple! You had nothing—young and alone—and I had everything. And I gave you the world! Kephallonia—in the palm of your hand!''\nKassandra again was pulled back into a memory. In the memory, Kassandra recovered after being dropped from [[Mount Taygetos]]. She heard a voice calling out for her.\n*'''Myrrine:''' ''KASSANDRA...!''\n*'''Young Kassandra:''' ''Ah!''\n[[File:Debt Collector - Kassandra and Ikaros - Assassins Creed Odyssey.png|thumb|250px|A young Kassandra with Ikaros]]\nKassandra pulled herself to her feet, finding fire around her, as well as [[Spear of Leonidas|the head of a spear]] lying on the ground. She took the spear, running through the forest with [[Ikaros]] flying overhead. Coming to a [[boat]] on the water's edge, she took it, pushing it out to see. A storm later destroyed the boat, and she washed ashore to be discovered by Markos.\n[[File:ACOD Debt Collector - Kassandra Joining Markos.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra joining Markos]]\n*'''Markos:''' ''Don't see fishies like you everyday, eh? You hungry? How about we make a deal? I do something for you, you do a few things for me... Everybody wins. Best offer you're gonna get! Think about it!''\n*'''Young Kassandra:''' ''...wait!''\nAs the memory faded with the pair walking off together up the beach, Kassandra returned to the present.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kephallonia. Some gift.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''You were nothing without Markos, and look how far we've come! From an orphan on the streets to a ''misthios'' with a [[Kephallonian hovel|hovel]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And now the Cyclops will take everything away. I can't protect you from him forever. He'll kill me too.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Oh, don't be scared of him! Look at you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How could I go up against him? With what weapons? A rusty [[spear]]? A broken [[bow]]?''\nThey were interrupted by [[Drucilla]], a local bowyer.\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''There you are! Skulking around a temple won't save you from me, Markos.''\n[[File:ACOD_Debt_Collector_-_Kassandra_Markos_Druccilla.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra with Markos and Drucilla]]\n*'''Markos:''' ''Drucilla! I was just talking about you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were?''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''I need that [[wood]], Markos. These new bows will be the talk of the island. I can't make anything with those bandit ''malákes'' stopping the wood shipments.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Of course you can't. Why, I was just filling my friend Kassandra in on the details. She already has a plan to deal with these bandits.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You know me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know me. Always prepared.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''What did I tell you? She will leave no stone unturned.''\n|-|...=\nKassandra looked in disbelief.\n*'''Markos:''' ''She's the silent but deadly type!''\n|-|No, I don't.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't know what you're talking about.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Of all the fucking phonies, Markos!''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Oh, she's just playing! It's a little game we have.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''I don't care ''who'' does it, but someone better gut those bandits. ''Today''.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''A wonderful idea. I for one, ah, need to rush home. Kassandra, I've cooked up a plan for our Cyclops dilemma. See me when you have time.''\nKassandra and Drucilla were then left alone.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you want your wood, you'll have to fix my broken bow first.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Hmm. I usually only pay when the deed is done, but shit's moving at a snail's pace. Follow me.''\nAs they departed to Drucilla's shop, they struck up a conversation.\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''These bows'll make me rich as [[Kroisos]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're that good, are they?''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''[[Peloponnesian War|War]]'s brewing. Then [[Athens|Athenians]] need good bows if they want to hold off the Spartans.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Everybody benefits, I guess.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Who are you, Markos? You should be tired of this small-time shit. You'd make a fortune in this war. Plus, I hear you're a secret Spartan.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was a long time ago. I'm a Kephallonian.''\n[[File:ACOD Drucilla Bow.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra receiving her new bow]]\nThey arrived at Drucilla's shop.\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Hand it over.''\nLater on, Drucilla returned.\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''There you go, good as new! That [[Improved Hunter Bow|bow]] is as strong as [[Herakles]] himself. Give it a try.''\nKassandra tested out the bow and hit every target dummy. Afterward, she returned to Sami to check back on Duris.\n*'''Duris:'''",

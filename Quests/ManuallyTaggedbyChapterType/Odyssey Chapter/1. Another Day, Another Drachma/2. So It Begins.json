    "General_Description": "'''So It Begins''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Whilst relaxing atop her [[Kephallonian hovel|home]], Kassandra was interrupted and brought two pieces of information.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra sat, humming while holding the top half of [[Spear of Leonidas|a spear]] atop her home.\n*'''Rogue:''' ''Hey, shit-face! Get down here!''\nKassandra proceeded to the edge of the building.\n*'''Rogue:''' ''[[Cyclops of Kephallonia|Cyclops]]' got a message for you!''\nKassandra leapt down to stand before the rogue and his companion.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell your boss he can stick it—''\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra punched by the Cyclops' thugs]]\nThe rogue's companion punched Kassandra in the face, making her nose bleed.\n*'''Rogue:''' ''That's for last week!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Maláka!\n*'''Rogue:''' ''The Cyclops said you like to act tough. So act tough!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get a little closer, and I will.''\n*'''Thug:''' ''You should know by now. The Cyclops always collects his debts. You have a lesson to learn.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the Cyclops wants to teach me, tell him to come here himself.''\n*'''Rogue:''' ''Never mess with the Cyclops!''\nAfter Kassandra knocked out the rogue and thug, she sat down, exhausted.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Last week? This shit happens ''every'' week. I can't keep doing this.''\nKassandra looked up as [[Ikaros]] landed and screeched. She tended to her nosebleed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thanks for the warning.''\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 6.png|thumb|250px|Phoibe arriving at Kassandra's home]]\n[[Phoibe]] ran around the corner.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''What happened to you?''\n*'''Mithios:''' ''It's nothing, Phoibe. All taken care of now.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''The Cyclops again, huh? Hasn't he learned his lesson yet?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Apparently not.''\nPhoibe proceeded to eat some of Kassandra's food.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course. Help yourself.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You hungry too, Ikaros? Do you think [[Jupiter|Zeus]] would bless me with an [[eagle]]? Like he blessed you? ...Maybe you could ask him for me!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Not this again.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phoibe...''\nKassandra stood up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've been over this.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I know, I know. He's just an eagle.''\n|-|I'll ask Zeus for you.=\nKassandra stood up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll try to put in a good word for you.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Finally!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So. What are you doing here?''\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 8.png|thumb|250px|Phoibe and Ikaros]]\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Oh! I almost forgot! [[Markos]] is looking for you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What does that weasel want now?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Don't know. He wants you to meet him at his new house. On his [[Markos' Vineyard|vineyard]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What? A ''vineyard''?'' Maláka''!''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''It's on the road to [[Sami]]. He says wine will make him rich!''\n(If \"How long has Markos had a vineyard?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Since when has he had a vineyard?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Yesterday I think.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So Markos—who owes ''me'' [[drachma]]e—is buying vineyards? With what money?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I dunno.''\n(If \"Where on the road to Sami?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find Markos's new, beautiful estate?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''You know the [[Lightning Zeus|statue of Zeus]] on [[Mount Ainos]]? It's south of that!''\n(\"I'll go find him.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I guess I owe Markos a little visit. Thank you, Phoibe.''\nPhoibe reached out her hand. Kassandra tossed a drachma into her hand.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I'll go tell Markos you're coming.''\nThe rogue and thug rose groggily to their feet as Phoibe departed with her eagle toy [[Chara]].\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Skree!''\n*'''Thug:''' ''My head...''\n<tabber>\n|-|Get out of here.=\nKassandra waved her hand in the direction of the main road.\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 9.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra sparing the thugs]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fun's over. Tell that one-eyed freak if he ever sends you here again, I'm gonna cut out his other eye and feed it to my bird.''\nShe jerked her thumb over her shoulder at Ikaros, who screeched. The two men ran off.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see Markos as soon as I'm dressed.''\nKassandra made her way to the vineyard. Along the way, she was ambushed by the Cyclops' thugs from earlier with more reinforcements.\n*'''Rogue:''' ''There she is! Get her!''\n*'''Thug:''' ''By [[Ares]], we'll slice you right open.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's what I get for sparing you? No manners.''\nKassandra killed the [[bandit]]s.\n|-|⚔️You're dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You made a mistake coming here.''\nKassandra killed the bandits.\n</tabber>\nKassandra made her way to the vineyard and sent Ikaros to scout ahead.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Guess this is the vineyard... Straight ahead. There you are. Let's see what you've gotten yourself into this time, Markos.''\nKassandra came upon Markos conversing with one of his farmers.\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 10.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra approaching Markos from behind]]\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Boss—I keep telling you—you can't do that.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Why? It's my farm! I can plant where I want.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''The [[grape]]s will die here—all of them.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''You have to forget what you know about the past, my friend—together, we will revolutionize wine making! Believe me, you will look back on this day and— ''\nKassandra nudged him from behind.\n*'''Markos:''' ''Kassandra, thank the [[Greek mythology|gods]]—Phoibe found you in time.''\nThe farmer walked away, muttering under his breath.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Thinks he can tell me about grapes...''\n*'''Markos:''' ''I can still hear you...''\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 11.png|thumb|250px|Markos confronted by Kassandra]]\nMarkos turned back to Kassandra.\n*'''Markos:''' ''I was worried sick. The Cyclops sent his scum to find you. I think they mean you harm.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wish you would have told me that ''before'' they hit me. But that's beside the point. You bought a vineyard, Markos? A ''vineyard''?!''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Why not? I like wine, you like wine. Everybody likes wine. Everybody buys wine! Why not from me?''\n<tabber>\n|-|You don't know how to make wine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Because you don't know how to grow grapes or make wine?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''I'm a fast learner! You grow grapes on the vine, then you get some wine!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's that simple, is it?''\n|-|You're going to fail.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Please, Markos. You'll fuck this up like you fuck up everything else. You can't pay me back in grapes.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Markos:''' ''You know me better than to think I don't have a plan. Markos ''always'' has a plan!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. Then do you have the money you owe me?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Do I have the money I owe you? Of course. Of course. Well, no. Not at the moment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then—get—it.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Instantly, my friend, instantly. But—maybe you should do that. There is a [[merchant]] in Sami—I'm not very good at these things as you know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to collect my own debt?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''It's just waiting for you in Sami, my friend.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who's the merchant?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''[[Duris]]. You know Duris. He's very nice.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Stop giving Duris money.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' '' ''Duris?'' How stupid can you get? Stop giving him money!''\n*'''Markos:''' ''He always pays me back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''After I threaten him.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Exactly—everybody benefits. Duris gets his money. I get my interest—and you have work. [[Kephallonia]] is wonderful, is it not?''\n|-|You're too kind to Duris.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Duris? Again? Why do you keep lending him money?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''He's a loyal friend. I don't want his family to starve.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a good friend, but you're bad with money.''\n</tabber>\n(If \"Where is Duris?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find Duris?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''In a shop in Sami overlooking the docks—you know this Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Will he be there?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''You mistake me for the [[Pythia (431 BCE)|Pythia]]. I couldn't possibly know.''\n(If \"How should I handle this?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How do you want to handle this one?''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Not like you handled that [[olive]] oil business. That was—that was too much.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I got the money.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''And now we'll never get any more from him. If you kill them all, nobody benefits. Threatening them and maybe more... Breaking things, certainly. Seal the money if you have to, but don't robe me of my customers. Unless you can't avoid it. These things happen.''\n(If \"I want my drachmae.\" chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He'd better have my money, Markos. I'd hate to have to sell ''our'' vineyard.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Of course he will! Oh, after there's another matter I want to discuss with you. After.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine, but I'm taking a [[horse]]. It's too hot and too long a walk to go on foot.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''But—''\nMarkos and Kassandra approached the nearby stables.\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 12.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Markos walking to the stables]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Think of it as interest, Markos. Everybody benefits.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Of course, my friend, you shall have your pick!''\n(If \"What about the horse on the left?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me about this one.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''The Skyros! You have an eye for sturdy stock, my friend! That horse can cling to mountain passes like a goat.''\n(If \"What about the horse in the middle?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The one in the middle. Tell me about it.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Ah! You have picked a beauty, my friend. That horse is from [[Thessaly|Thessalonia]]. Bred for its courage.''\n(If \"What about the horse on the right?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I like the look of the one on the right.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Ah, the [[Makedonia]]n. These are bred for battle. A true warrior's horse!''\n(\"I'm ready to choose.\")\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 13.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Markos at the stables]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've made my choice.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Which one will it be?''\n(Note: Despite the descriptions, there is no difference between the horses except for color.)\n*'''Markos:''' ''A, uh, a fine choice. But, this particular breed has a few... quirks that you might not be aware of. I wouldn't want you to take an unworthy horse.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is the one I want.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Are you sure, because—''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure, Markos.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Everybody benefits. Especially ''you!'' You've chosen the great [[Phobos (horse)|Phobos]]. He's never let me down!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phobos.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Remember, meet me at the temple in Sami when you have, uh, your money from Duris.''\nThe farmer [[Euterpe]] walked up to the pair.\n[[File:ACOD So It Begins 14.png|thumb|250px|Euterpe speaking to Markos]]\n*'''Markos:''' ''Ah, Euterpe! There's plenty of wine left to buy. Don't fret.''\n*'''Euterpe:''' ''Not now, you fool! Phoibe's been taken.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By who?''\n*'''Euterpe:''' ''Thugs of the Cyclops—who else? Snatched her right off the main road!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where they went.''\n*'''Euterpe:''' ''In the direction of [[Ktimene Beach]].''\n*'''Markos:''' ''The beach? Can she swim?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get her.''\n*'''Markos:''' ''Yes, go. But don't forget about dear Duris, Kassandra!''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra defended herself against thugs sent by the Cyclops. Later, she reluctantly agreed to help Markos reclaim his money, but not before learning of Phoibe's capture by the Cyclops' thugs.",

Rich, poor, philosopher, or farmer\u2014and I'm helpless to stop it.''\n(If players asked \"What is happening to everyone?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's happening to the victims?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''Leaking, pustulant rashes, raging fevers, pallid, sweaty skin. I find many dying in their own excrement.''\n(If players chose \"There must be something you can do.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is there nothing that can be done?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''I try and ease the suffering where I can.''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''The plague is spreading through the victims' excretions\u2014I'm sure of it. The bodies must be burned.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Athens is lucky to have you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your compassion for the people has always inspired me.''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''Unfortunately compassion is all I have to give.

Fanatics are roaming the streets, trying to stop me in my work.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What fanatics?''\n*'''Hippokrates:''' ''The [[Followers of Ares]]\u2014superstitious fools. They believe burning the dead is sacrilege, and attacked me. Can you believe it?''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll help.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These Followers of Ares don't worry me. I'll help burn the bodies.''\nKassandra began gathering the bodies one at a time and tossing them onto the funeral pyres.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''May you reach [[underworld|Hades]] safely.''\nA number of Followers of Ares fanatics and some of the dogs attacked her as she worked, but she dispatched them all the same.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all of them.''",

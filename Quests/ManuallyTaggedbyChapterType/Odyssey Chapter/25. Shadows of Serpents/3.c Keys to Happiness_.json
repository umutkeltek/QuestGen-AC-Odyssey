    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra returned to Bryce at the entrance to the [[Petrified Temple]] with what she needed.\n\n(Mercenary fought, [[Heavy is the Spear]] completed)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Zetes the Retired|Mercenary]] knew nothing. He never made it inside the lair.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Then it was a waste of time! Ligeia waits, and we've done nothing to help her!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not exactly\u2014the Mercenary carried this spear, which he claims killed the Writhing Dread.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''No, no, the Creature took Ligeia! It ''can't'' be dead\u2014it awaits in its lair, even now!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then there may be a piece of this puzzle we don't yet understand.''\n(Mercenary spoken to, but not fought)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found the Mercenary. Just another man obsessed with his spear.''\nBryce snorted and rolled her eyes.\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Aren't they all?''\nBryce asked what he knew.\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Well? What else did the Mercenary know? How do we get inside to save Ligeia and kill the Creature?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't question him very thoroughly. ...Or take his spear.''\nKassandra rubbed the back of her head.\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Then who knows what vital clue you may have missed?!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It might be worth returning to see what he knows...''\n\nWhether Kassandra spoke to the mercenary or not, Bryce asked if she found the key.\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Have you found a way inside the lair?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ligeia's story was true. The Daughters of Artemis were protecting this... [[Gorgon Disk|Disk]]... Key? This\u2014''\nKassandra held out the disk, struggled to describe it, then gave up with a sigh. She returned it to her pack.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have what opens the lair.''\n\n('Heavy is the Spear' complete)\n*'''Bryce:''' ''And... You didn't hurt any of the Daughters when you took it?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Lie \u2013 I killed them silently.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They didn't hear me or my blades... but they felt them, Bryce.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Why?! Why would you\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This disk is a prized possession\u2014if I hadn't killed them, I never would have made it out alive, and Ligeia would be lost.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''I\u2014I suppose you did what you had to. Ligeia's worth any price.''\n|-|Nobody died.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There was no need for violence. The Daughters of Artemis didn't even know I was there.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Then [[Tyche]] truly is on our side. Ligeia still stands a chance.''\n</tabber>\n\n('Heavy is the Spear' not complete)\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Then what are you waiting for? Use the disk! Open the door!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Accept \u2013 Let's go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no time for the Mercenary. Whatever he knows/ we'll find out ourselves. We're opening that door, now.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''You have Ligeia's heart, Kassandra.''\n|-|I need to talk to the Mercenary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''...No. I'm not walking in there without talking to the Mercenary first. He might know something we could use.''\n*'''Bryce:''' ''He might know how not to be a ''coward!'' Kassandra, Ligeia needs us now! Open the door. Open it!''\nBryce fumed as Kassandra left once again. \n\nWhen Kassandra returned, Bryce was still furious.\n{{#tag:tabber|\n'Heavy is the Spear' still not complete=\n*'''Bryce:''' ''The cowardly ''misthios''! What terribly important items might you need now, before you keep your promise to save my lover?''\n:Repeat of dialogue options from [[A Slithery Plea]]\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n'Heavy is the Spear' complete=\n*'''Bryce:''' ''Did you find anything, coward?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found the  Mercenary's [[Gorgon Slayer|spear]].

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra gathered what she needed to enter the Petrified Temple.",
    "Section_Trivia": "* The dialogue with Bryce does not acknowledge Kassandra being the leader of the Daughters of Artemis, should the player have earned that title during [[Artemis's Request]]. Being the leader allows you to enter the village and the cave peacefully during [[Hard to Artemis]], but when Bryce asks you if you killed any Daughters, there are no options that reflect this peaceful method.",

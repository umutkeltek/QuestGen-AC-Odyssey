    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra arrived at the Sanctuary of Olympia.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Sanctuary of Olympia! Where the greatest athletes compete for fame and glory.''\nShe travelled to the [[Stadium, Olympia|Stadium]], where [[Ikaros]] spotted the pankration organizer, [[Paios]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to talk to him.''\nAs she approached, he barked for final check-ins.\n*'''Paios:''' ''Pankration here! Last chance to claim your spot!''\nKassandra spoke to him to check in.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here for the pankration.''\n*'''Paios:''' ''You must be joking. The only fighter we're missing is Testikles.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm replacing him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's a little under the... water\u2014I mean weather.''<br>I'm'' the one taking his place.''\n*'''Paios:''' ''OK, OK. Save it for the fight.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 That's me.=\nKassandra placed her hands on her hips.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm Testikles.''\n*'''Paios:''' ''You're Testikles?! The same Testikles I went out drinking with last season, the one who made advances on my wife... and brother?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Er... The diet and training is... transformative.''\n*'''Paios:''' ''Obviously...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people came for a show. I'll give them one.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Paios:''' ''This is unprecedented, but the crowd will riot if the pankration is cancelled.<br>Very well. The competition begins shortly.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to go.''\nPaios nodded and led her inside. Kassandra changed into her athletic attire and stepped into the ring, facing her competitor, [[Orion (Olympian)|Orion]].\n<tabber>\n|-|Kallias alive=\n[[File:ACOD The Contender - Kallias and Leander at the Olympics.png|thumb|250px|Leander introducing Kallias]]\n*'''[[Leander]]:''' ''Welcome all, it is my pleasure to introduce to you [[Kallias]]. A former champion here in this stadium, and now an esteemed judge in Olympia.''\nThe crowd, including [[Alkibiades]], applauded for Kallias' arrival.\n*'''Kallias:''' ''My friends, it is an honor for me to introduce this event, one so close to my heart.'' \n*'''Kallias:''' ''The pankration!''\nThe crowd continued applauding.\n*'''Kallias:''' ''I will not delay you with words, for we all want to see action.''\nKallias turned towards Kassandra and Orion.\n*'''Kallias:''' ''For [[Zeus]], let the competition commence!''\nKassandra and Orion prepared to battle.\n*'''Orion:''' ''I'll squish you like a bug.''\n|-|Kallias dead=\n*'''[[Leander]]:''' ''Welcome to Olympia. Today we gather not in war, but in peace\u2014to honor Zeus and [[Hera]].''\nAlkibiades, among the crowd, begins to recite a poem.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''\"So I, the [[Muses]]' nectar shedding; To conquerors deal the draught divine; Whose brow, with garlands amply spreading; [[Python|Pytho]] and Olympia twine. Blest the sound of virtuous fame\u2014\"''\nLeander cut him off.\n*'''Leander:''' ''There could be no more fitting tribute than a quote from [[Pindar]]. Let the contest begin!''\nKassandra stretched her shoulders while Orion boasted.\n*'''Orion:''' ''I'll crush you like an ant.''\n</tabber>\nOrion attacked Kassandra, who countered his first blow.\n*'''Orion:''' ''That's not fair!''\nOrion got one good hit.\n*'''Orion:''' ''Huh, you'll be easy!''\nShe landed a few more blows on him.\n*'''Orion:''' ''It hurts!''\n*'''Leander:''' ''That's a big hit!''\n*'''Leander:''' ''I'm glad I'm not in there!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where's your tough talk gone now?''\nLeander was pleased with the fight.\n*'''Leander:''' ''This is a fight you'll talk about for a long time!''\nKassandra tired of toying with him and finished him off.\n*'''Orion:''' ''Why you...<br>Please, please by the gods... No more!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Kallias alive=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was your best?''\n*'''Kallias:''' ''That was but the beginning.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What?''\n*'''Leander:''' ''Now that our contestant is warmed up, let's see what she can do against [[Erastos (Olympian)|ERASTOS]]!''\nThe next competitor, Erastos, stepped into the ring while rubbing his hands.\n*'''Kallias:''' ''Good luck...''\n|-|Kallias dead=\nOrion officially yielded, and Kassandra won the round.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was easy.''\nLeander applauds.\n*'''Leander:''' ''A strong start.''\nKassandra did a double take.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Start?!''\n*'''Leander:''' ''All welcome our next opponent, Erastos!''\nThe next opponent, Erastos, arrived and the fight began.\n</tabber>\n*'''Erastos:''' ''Don't blink or you'll be seeing stars!''\n[[File:Olympia-KassOrestes.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra fighting Erastos]]\nKassandra landed a blow on Erastos.\n*'''Leander:''' ''Wow!''\n*'''Leander:''' ''Another big hit!''\nHe got in a good hit of his own.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come on, that's the spirit!''\nAlkibiades cheered for her.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Come on, beautiful\u2014you've got this!''\nErastos' dodging was somewhat greater than that of Orion.\n*'''Erastos:''' ''Too slow!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stand still and let me hit you!''\nThe fight continued as they exchanged blows.\n*'''Leander:''' ''I don't know how they're still standing!''\nErastos got in another good hit.\n*'''Erastos:''' ''This [[scorpion]] stings!''\nAfter a somewhat greater challenge than before, Kassandra won the second round as well. The crowd cheered with Leander clapping for Kassandra's performance.\n*'''Leander:''' ''The crowd loves you... but you're not done yet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not done?!''\n*'''Leander:''' ''A fine offering to the gods, wouldn't you say?<br>Soon, we will return for the final contest\u2014the mighty Kassandra against our reigning champion, [[Dorieus]]!''\n[[File:ACOD The Contender Memory Screenshot 08.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra meeting Alkibiades and Barnabas after the event]]\nKassandra opened her mouth slightly as though to speak, but then uttered a weary sigh and walked off. Kassandra changed back into her normal garb and met with Alkibiades and [[Barnabas]].\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Astounding! To think I could be a companion to an Olympic champion.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''You're even better at sparring than I am\u2014''\nAlkibiades held his fist near his chest, and Barnabas and Kassandra looked at each other with concern.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Though if [[Sokrates]] were a more willing partner...''\n[[File:ACOD The Contender Memory Screenshot 09.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Barnabas tending to Alkibiades]]\nAlkibiades collapsed and retched, and Barnabas and Kassandra tended to him.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Alkibiades, are you all right?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I was... with my friends [[Demophanes]] and Kallias. Respected Olympic judges, no less...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Too much cheap wine?''\nAlkibiades stared at her with uncharacteristic annoyance.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You look like you drank from [[Medea]]'s cup...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Medea's cup? You think he's been poisoned?''\n(If players asked \"Where were you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were... celebrating?''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''It's the Olympics. What's not to celebrate? We were at the [[Leonidaion]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'm going to find Demophanes.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you've been poisoned, I need to find these judges.''\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Poisoned? Do you think that they could be too or... No. Never! They're good men you can't think one of them... They host a celebration every Olympics to celebrate the sacred truce.''\nAlkibiades proceeded to vomit. Kassandra turned to Barnabas.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stay with him. I'll find out what happened.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra replaced Testikles in the pankration Olympics. She defeated Orion and Erastos, advancing to the finals against the reigning champion Dorieus. After the event, she met with Alkibiades and Barnabas, the former collapsing and presumed poisoned. Kassandra decided to investigate the celebration he attended.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Kallias can be killed prior to this quest, which in turn will affect Leander's introduction to the pankration event and Kassandra's fights. The intermission is the same, however, and Alkibiades is still poisoned. The dialogue always references Kallias as host of the celebration, which is either an oversight or indicates that he arranged the poisoning to take place with or without him present.\n**As Alkibiades did not collapse until after the opening rounds at the pankration, it is more likely he attended the celebration beforehand and the poison itself was slow acting.",

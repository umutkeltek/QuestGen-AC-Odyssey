    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra hurried to the [[Leonidaion]]. Upon entering, she was greeted by several corpses of men and women alike.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This was definitely poison, and Alkibiades wasn't the only victim.''\nAs she took a turn, out to a hallway, she saw more bodies.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Olympic Truce|truce]] is fragile enough...''\nShe then went to the kitchen on the opposite side, near the entrance. She walked to the center towards the preparation table and examined the mixture of food.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This food smells strange, but it's not rotten.''\nKassandra looked around and saw wine jugs sitting atop a storage chest and immediately deduced their contents.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This proves it, poison! It must have been added to the food and wine.''\nShe then entered the empty larder room and read the banquet supply list left in the corner.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hmm, a supply list for the celebration... and the merchant's name.<br />Time to pay this [[Priam]] a visit.''\nIn a stoa near the entrance and the [[Stables of Olympia|stables]], Kassandra met the merchant in his [[Priam's shop|shop]], but she was ambushed by a [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]] guard before she could confront him. She killed the ambusher and returned her attention to Priam, cracking her knuckles.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now we're going to have a conversation.''\nHe cowered in fear.\n*'''Priam:''' ''Please, please, I was just doing what I was told.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm your boss now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now you'll do what ''I'' tell you.''\nKassandra grabbed him by the throat.\n*'''Priam:''' ''Please, I thought we were just trying to make them slow\u2014you know, so they lose. Win a few [[drachma]]e...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My friend [[Alkibiades]] may already be dead, and you're talking about drachmae.''\n*'''Priam:''' ''The golden boy? I was there. He didn't have much\u2014if you can get him the antidote, he'll survive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where it is.''\nShe let go and pushed him back.\n*'''Priam:''' ''They're sure to have it at [[Fort Koroibos]]. A man there paid me to do this. Look there.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nAttack \u2013 First, you must pay.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whoever did this will pay, but I'll take care of you first.''\nPriam fled in fear.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLeave \u2013 Get out of my sight.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whoever did this will pay. Go, and don't let me see your face again.''\n*'''Priam:''' ''Yes, thank you...''\n}}\n|-|Attack \u2013 For that you will die.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your actions could cost Alkibiades his life. Now you will pay with yours.''\nPriam fled in fear.\n|-|Help me and I'll spare you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not after you, just whoever wanted this done.''\n*'''Priam:''' ''I don't know, I never saw him. I just thought he wanted to fix a race, but then I saw what started happening and I knew they'd been poisoned.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My friend Alkibiades\u2014I need to save him.''\n*'''Priam:''' ''You'll like find the antidote up at [[Fort Koroibos]].''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nAttack \u2013 First, you must pay.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whoever did this will pay, but I'll take care of you first.''\nPriam fled in fear.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLeave \u2013 Get out of my sight.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whoever did this will pay. Go, and don't let me see your face again.''\n*'''Priam:''' ''Yes, thank you...''\n}}\n</tabber>\nRegardless, Kassandra learned where to get the antidote. She infiltrated Fort Koroibos, wherein she located the antidote.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the antidote.''\nBack at the Sanctuary, she found Alkibiades and Barnabas in the [[Olympic Clinic|clinic]] near Leonidaion. Alkibiades rested on one of the beds.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, I have the antidote.''\n[[File:ACOD_The_Long_Game_-_Alkibiades_drinking_antidote.png|thumb|250px|Alkibiades drinking the antidote]]\nBarnabas took the antidote and handed it to Alkibiades, who sat up to drink. The antidote took effect immediately.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''Ugh, more wine please, to wash away the taste.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''A treatment worthy of [[Hippokrates]]!''\nAlkibiades looked up to Kassandra and smiled wryly.\n*'''Alkibiades:''' ''I can already feel my ''stamina'' returning...''\nBarnabas rubbed the back of his head and cleared his throat. He addressed Kassandra.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Didn't you have one last fight in the pankration?''\nShe agreed and turned her gaze to Alkibiades.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go.''\nAlkibiades stood up and followed them out.",

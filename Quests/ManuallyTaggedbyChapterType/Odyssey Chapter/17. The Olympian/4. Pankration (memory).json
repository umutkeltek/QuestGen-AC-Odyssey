    "Section_Dialogue": "Having tended to [[Alkibiades]], Kassandra returned to the organizer [[Paios]] at the [[Stadium, Olympia|Stadium]].\n*'''Paios:''' ''Your next opponent is Doreius\u2014claims to be descended from [[Herakles]] himself!''\n(Accept \u2013 \"Time to fight.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready.''\n*'''Paios:''' ''You ever faced an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion before?''\n----\n(If players successfully concocted the body oil for [[Testikles]].)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, but I've gotten this far.''\n'''Paios:''' ''Well, you don't look the part\u2014you're not even oiled, for [[Zeus]]'s sake!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I have oil.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do have some oil. It could come in handy... and it smelled good. I'll use it.''\nPaios nodded in agreement.\n|-|I have no need for oil.=\n'''Kassandra:''' ''Less talking. More fighting.''\n</tabber>\n----\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've fought all sorts of people... and they were with more than just their fists. Let me in there.''\nPaios shrugged as he led Kassandra inside the [[Stadium, Olympia|Stadium]] once again.\n:(If [[Kallias]] was not killed beforehand)\n:Before Kassandra could enter, she encountered Kallias, a member of the [[Cult of Kosmos]] whom she deduced had poisoned Alkibiades. They exchanged words with an undertone of hostile intent.\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come to wish me luck?''\n:*'''Kallias:''' ''Of course, and if you win you should come dine with me sometime.''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe I'll hunt you down after the event... To take you up on your offer.''\n:Kassandra walked up to the towering Kallias, who squinted down at her and her choice of words.\n:*'''Kallias:''' ''Of course... after the event.''\n:Kallias walked away.\nKassandra entered the Stadium to change into her athlete outfit. She took her mark in the arena, and [[Leander]] walked out to greet her.\n:(If players chose to apply the body oil to Kassandra.)\n:*'''Leander:''' ''Huh. You smell better than last time.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's get this over with.''\n*'''Leander:''' ''For [[Hera]]!''\nLeander turned and walked back to the crowd.\n*'''Leander:''' ''We've seen our esteemed newcomer rise quickly to become a contender...''\n*'''Leander:''' ''But let's see how she goes against our reigning champion... Doreius!''\n[[File:ACO Pankration Memory Screenshot 01.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Dorieus before the fight]]\nThe brutish Dorieus entered the arena and gesticulated. He took his mark, stretched his shoulders, and the final round began.\n\nAs the fight started, Kassandra landed a few blows on Dorieus.\n*'''Leander:''' ''By the gods!''\nDorieus' size did not encumber his dodging, however. He hit back as good as he got.\n*'''Dorieus:''' ''I will suck the marrow from your bones!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll have to try harder if you want to live!''\nDorieus continued his assault.\n*'''Dorieus:''' ''I hope you like pain.''\nIn time, Kassandra turned the tide on her opponent.\n*'''Leander:''' ''Just one mistake can change everything!''\nAfter a challenging exchange, Kassandra finally overwhelmed Dorieus.\n*'''Leander:''' ''Victory! [[Nike]]!''\n[[File:ACO Pankration Memory Screenshot 03.png|thumb|250px|The coronation ceremony]]\nThe crowded applauded. Kassandra clasped her hands and bowed, then applauded her performance. The crowd later gathered at the [[Olympic Tree]] to witness Leander crown Kassandra as the pre-eminent Olympic champion, and [[Sparta]] as the overall winner.\n*'''Leander:''' ''The gods have looked kindly on these, our champions... but there can only be one winner!''\n*'''Leander:''' ''SPARTA!!!''\nKassandra walked up to Leander, with the crowd cheering behind. She turned around to be coronated with an [[olive]] {{Wiki|Olive wreath|wreath}}.\n*'''Leander:''' ''Yours is eternal glory!''\nA wide smile shone across Kassandra's face as her task for the [[two Kings of Sparta]] was officially completed.",

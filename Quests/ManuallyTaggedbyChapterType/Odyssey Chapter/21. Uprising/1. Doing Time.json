Or ''I'' could come in there and end you anytime I please. But before that. Tell me what you know.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought your Cultists told you everything. Sounds like you're on their side, but they're not on yours.''\n*'''Deimos:''' ''You think I'm just a puppet? Then prove it to me. Tell me why ''I'm'' on the wrong side.

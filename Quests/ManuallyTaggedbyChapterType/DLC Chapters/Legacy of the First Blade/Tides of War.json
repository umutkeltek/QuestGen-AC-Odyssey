What do you know about the weapon plans?''\n*'''Parmys:''' ''My husband scattered code books around [[Achaia]]. Some are amongst the [[Phila|Tempest]]'s fleet and others are in the [[Patrai Military Shipyard|shipyard]]. With them, you'll learn how to build and install the weapon. Then you can end the Tempest and avenge my husband.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Your husband will be avenged.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll end the Tempest with or without your husband's weapon. Either way, he'll be avenged.''\n|-|I will do my best.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Tempest's fleet is powerful. Avenging your husband will be difficult. But I'll try.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Parmys:''' ''He would be happy to hear that.''\n(Asked \"Where are the ships?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There plenty of ships in Achaia. What should I look for?''\n*'''Parmys:''' ''The Tempest's ships patrolling the harbor will be a good place to start.''\n(Asked \"Where is the shipyard?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said some of the code books are in the shipyard. Where is it?''\n*'''Parmys:''' ''The Patrai Military Shipyard is the one at the edge of the city.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll get started.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find those code books.''\n[[File:ACOD Tides of War 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the book beneath the stairs on the ship]]\nKassandra travelled to the Patrai Military Shipyard. [[Ikaros]] called out one of the code books on a prototype [[trireme]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found it!''\nKassandra infiltrated the shipyard and retrieved the book.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be one of the code books the engineer's wife mentioned. I can't understand any of this, but maybe [[Barnabas]] can.''\nIkaros spied another on a column beneath the roof of the warehouse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see it.''\n[[File:ACOD Tides of War 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra recovering the book beneath the roof]]\nShe climbed to the book and retrieved it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Another code book. Good.''\nKassandra left the shipyard and travelled to the [[Adrestia]]. She departed Patrai and sailed after the ships carrying the code books. Ikaros identified them from the air.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's what I'm looking for.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There it is!''\n[[File:ACOD Tides of War 4.png|thumb|250px|The ''Adrestia'' chasing down the ships containing the book]]\nThe books were aboard [[Sparta]]n patrol ships.  Kassandra ordered the crew to open fire on them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's destroy the patrols before they call for reinforcements.''\nShe destroyed a Spartan ship and recovered a code book.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A code book. I'll give this to Barnabas.''\nKassandra chased down the other ship and recovered the last book.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That should be the last of them.''\nAfter some time, the Chimera's Breath was successfully installed at the bow of the Adrestia.",

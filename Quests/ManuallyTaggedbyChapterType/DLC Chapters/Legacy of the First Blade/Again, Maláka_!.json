How dare you liberate my brother's [[Goat farm|farm]] from [[Order of the Ancients|goat-blood-drinking-fools]]! I, [[Aiantides]] the Proud, will never be indebted to anyone. ''Mal\u00e1ka''! Your altruism is driving me to the brink of poverty!<br /><br />You will find treasure on the islets of [[Makedonia]] as a final thank you. Now enough, Eagle Bearer, please! I'm leaving Makedonia and I look forward to not seeing you again.''\nKassandra headed south to the islets of Makedonia, in the middle body of water of the [[Triple Peninsula of Chalkidike]]. [[Ikaros]] helped her scout out each islet.\n\n[Large middle islet]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the place.''\nOn the large middle islet, she eliminated a group of bandits looking for the treasure before claiming the pouch herself. She then proceeded to the rest of the islets. \n\n[Small middle islet]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is it.''\nThe small middle islet was only a short swim from the larger one to its west.\n\n[East islet]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm where I need to be.''\nOn the east islet, Kassandra slew a couple of bears before claiming the treasure cache.\n\n[Southwest islet]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here we are.''\nOn the southwest islet, Kassandra faced some temperamental chickens.\n\nFrom the fourth cache, she recovered a pair of [[Grocer's Gauntlets|gauntlets]] and a [[Hammer of Hemorrhaging|warhammer]] and concluded her treasure hunt.",

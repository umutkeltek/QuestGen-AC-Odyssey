    "General_Description": "'''The Ordering of the Kosmos''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra identified and assassinated [[Dimokrates]], member of the [[Order of Dominion]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled to the [[Vista of Pylos]] overlooking the city of [[Aipeia]]. As she stood observing the ruined [[Palace of Aphareus]] nearby, [[Darius]] arrived behind her.\n*'''Darius:''' ''That's the meeting place.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you know about this man in [[Amorges]]' inner circle?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''[[Dimokrates]]. Drachmae is his weapon of choice. If we kill him, the Order's ability to influence the Greek world will be severely damaged. His death will bring us one step closer to Amorges. To [[Elpidios]].''\n<tabber>\n|-|Drachmae is a deadly weapon.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Drachma]]e can be as deadly as any other weapon. I should know. Enough of it can kill anyone.''\n|-|Drachmae is no match for me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I like drachmae. But it can't buy the kind of edge my blades provide. Not when I'm driven to find my son.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Darius:''' ''There's only one problem regarding Dimokrates.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's that?''\nDarius paused, then spoke flatly.\n*'''Darius:''' ''I don't know what he looks like.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then we'll have to listen closely when we approach.''\n[[File:ACOD The Ordering of the Kosmos 4.png|thumb|250px|Darius and Kassandra waiting at the ruins]]\nDarius led on to the watchtower, where they lay in wait. Night fell, and the meeting got underway.\n*'''Darius:''' ''If anything goes wrong, remember it's Dimokrates we're after.''\nThe [[Order of the Ancients|Order]] representatives approached the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]] guard.\n*'''Darius:''' ''The Order has arrived...''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''You're late.''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''We arrived precisely when we meant to.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Remember, once Dimokrates shows himself, we kill him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Or we can kill everyone...''\n<tabber>\n|-|Eavesdrop=\nDarius got into position as the meeting continued. The gathered entourage began moving away from the palace as they spoke.\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''I'm assuming you've brought what we need.''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''About that. We're not sure we're giving you any more.''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''You don't make that call. This is the way it's always worked\u2014you provide the drachmae. We have the weapons, the [[Sparta]]ns, and the [[Peloponnesian War|war]]. You get what you want. We get what we want.''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''Not anymore. You need to prove to the Order you're worth what we're paying.''\nThey stopped halfway down the hill.\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''I know your entire organization have allowed themselves to be pinned and mounted by this ''misthios'' and her [[Ikaros|pet bird]]. Consider this your final chance to do your duty and back us up in [[Messenia]].''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''You clearly don't know the Eagle Bearer. And who are you to throw away our alliance? As far back as [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], we've been working together towards peace.''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''Peace? Don't lecture ''me'' about peace. You're the ones who've plunged the Greek world into endless conflict for your own benefit. You think we don't know?''\nThe representative spat in contempt.\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''Amorges was right. How far the Cult of Kosmos has fallen. The value we've given to this alliance, I'll never understand.''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''I should kill you where you stand!''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''Think ''very'' carefully about what you're about to do.''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''Gods strike you down, Dimokrates! Gods strike you down... You just keep paying, and we'll keep our end of the deal.''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''This meeting is over.''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''So we continue the arrangement... Dimokrates?''\nKassandra had eavesdropped long enough to identify the blue-robed representative, who had done most of the talking, as Dimokrates.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's him. That's Dimokrates.''\nKassandra stalked after him and his entourage after they had parted ways with the Cult guards. They approached their horses.\n*'''Dimokrates:''' ''To the [[Mount Ithome Fort|fort]]!''\nHis entourage mounted and galloped off, but Kassandra pursued him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He thinks a fort will save him from ''me''?''\nKassandra infiltrated the fort and found Dimokrates. He cried out when he noticed her.\n*'''Dimokrates:''' ''The Eagle Bearer is after us!''\nShe ran after him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dimokrates!''\n*'''Dimokrates:''' ''Filth! You disgust me!''\nFor good measure, Kassandra went after the other two Order representatives. She struck at the orange-robed representative.\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''I can't wait to tell my children I killed the Eagle Bearer.''\nKassandra killed him, denying him the opportunity. She moved on to the green-robed representative in the upper bastion.\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''You're nothing! Your blood is nothing.''\nKassandra killed the representative with ease.\n|-|Kill everyone=\nWhether their cover was blown or Kassandra simply forwent stealth, the Order and the Cult drew their weapons on sight.\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''Gods! It's the Eagle Bearer!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire.\n*'''Dimokrates:''' ''It's her...''\nDimokrates ordered a retreat.\n*'''Dimokrates:''' ''To safety!''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Get Dimokrates. I'll handle this.''\nKassandra chased after Dimokrates while Darius covered her.\n*'''Dimokrates:''' ''Artabanus? How? Stop him!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll figure out which one's Dimokrates after they're dead.''\n*'''Order Representative:''' ''Stand your ground!''\n*'''Cult Guard:''' ''Kill them!''\nKassandra caught up to the representatives and killed the first one.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not Dimokrates...''\nShe killed the second.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This isn't Dimokrates either...''\nBy process of elimination, the blue-robed representative who had done most of the talking was Dimokrates. She slew him and confirmed his death.\n</tabber>\nRegardless of her methods, Kassandra found her target and confirmed his death.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got him. Dimokrates is dead. One step closer to Elpidios... I've got to return to Darius.''\n[[File:ACOD The Ordering of the Kosmos 8.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra reporting Dimokrates' death to Darius]]\nWith Dimokrates dead, Kassandra returned to Darius at the cliff east of the watchtower, overlooking Aipeia.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dimokrates is dead.''\nHer temper flared once more.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They deserve to die for what they've done, Darius. Every last one of them.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Kassandra...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're between Elpidios and me.''\nKassandra turned to leave, and Darius left as well after a brief pause, seemingly lamenting the anger consuming her.",

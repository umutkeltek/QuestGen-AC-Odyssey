    "General_Description": "'''The Last Magi''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Gergis]], a [[Magus]] of the [[Order of Dominion]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Having read the letter received from [[Pebble]], Kassandra travelled to the graveyard of [[Aipeia]]. There, an older man stood before her.\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Eagle Bearer. Well met. I see you got my note. I'm surprised I'm still alive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That could change.''\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Hasty. No need to be hasty, Eagle Bearer. Let me introduce myself.<br>My name is Gergis, the last Magi of the Order. I've been eager to meet you, Kassandra. May I call you as such?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Call me what you want.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't really care what you call me.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Confident. I like that.''\n|-|Don't call me Kassandra.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Only my friends can call me Kassandra.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''We may become friends yet\u2014who's to say?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give me one good reason not to put my blade through your throat. Where is [[Amorges]]? Where is my [[Elpidios|son]]?''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I have the answers you seek, Kassandra. I know what happened in [[Achaia]]\u2014in the village called [[Dyme]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dyme? What do you know? Tell me.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I was there. Things are never what they seem. Your reality is limited to what you perceive. Ride with me. I've been wanting to speak to you.''\nGergis walked to a [[horse]].\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I'll show you how beautiful our world can be. Shall we?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One wrong move\u2014''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I understand. This way.''\nGergis and Kassandra mounted nearby horses. The ''misthios'' followed Gergis.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where are you taking me?''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Somewhere nice. I want to learn more about you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't trust you.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I've followed your journey from the beginning. I've written quite a bit about you, actually. In fact, some of my most popular work is about the Eagle Bearer. In addition, I've heard of your tales from our ''[[Cult of Kosmos|friends]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Cult of Kosmos|Kosmos]]? I didn't think the Cult made friends.''\nGergis chuckled at her remark.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Allies then, if you prefer.''\nThey rode up a wooded hill leading southwest.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I've written many stories scattered across the [[Greece|Greek]] world. I spread the word of our doings, of our heroic deeds.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Heroic\"? You call murdering innocents and burning villages \"heroic\"?''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Narrow. The [[Order of the Ancients|Order]] sees things from a broader perspective. We do not seek ephemeral peace. Our work is ''eternal.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka.\nThey reached the top of the hill.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Look around us\u2014such promise! You must be wondering why we hunt you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've killed enough of you to have an idea.''\nThey rode down the hill and continued southwest through the valley.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''You're a [[Tainted One|force of nature]], Kassandra. Have you noticed? Danger is drawn to you like vultures to a battlefield. And so we simply cannot allow you to exist.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You would kill someone because of their blood? You disgust me.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''We're not the enemy. Have you considered yourself? In our eyes ''you'' are the manifestation of turmoil, the disruptor of peace. Don't be so quick to judge, Kassandra. There are many perspectives.''\nGergis and Kassandra continued riding, reaching the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea and a [[Shipwreck of Nestor|small island]] in the distance. They dismounted from their horses. A small memorial had been set up for [[Pactyas (Ancients)|The Huntsman]], [[Phila|The Tempest]], and [[The Immortals]].\n*'''Gergis:''' ''We've arrived. Look at that view!''\nGergis turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''[[Messenia]]. Quite a beauty, isn't she?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Get to the point.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I know what happened in Dyme. How [[Natakas]] died. Are you brave enough to hear the truth?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me what happened in Dyme.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want to know everything.''\nThe scene shifted as Gergis recounted the night in Dyme. He and his guards had searched for Natakas and Elpidios at a shipwreck.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''We saw no one at the beach that day\u2014no Natakas, no child, They had escaped. Or so we thought... until we heard a cry. It was coming from a ship, wrecked on the shore\u2014the soft but unmistakable cry of a child.''\nA guard investigated the origin of the cry, coming from behind the hull where Natakas and Elpidios were hiding.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpidios...''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''There was nowhere to run. Natakas tried to resist, but... it was futile. The baby was all that remained.''\nAn Order guard cut down Natakas. Gergis held Elpidios and looked from the slain father to the baby with pity in his expression.  \n\nThe scene returned to the present as Gergis finished his tale.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will find Amorges\u2014''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''I'm sure he would expect you to try.''\n|-|I don't want to know.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know all I need to\u2014Natakas is gone.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Some tales are better left untold.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you want from me?''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Our stories are written by a rare few who have the power to shape them. It's not every day I can speak to someone like you. There are no absolutes, Kassandra. Not even with Tainted Ones. You are ''fire''\u2014born with the potential to destroy, but also to warm, to cast a light in the dark.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A warmth you tried to destroy.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''People die, Kassandra. Eventually, we'll all be forgotten\u2014fading away like a distant dream. Our actions, however, if they are meaningful, will be remembered.<br>Tell me, what do you want to be remembered for?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Bravery.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want to be remembered as someone who never backed down from a fight, even if the odds were stacked against them.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Insight. Such wonderful insight. Thank you.<br />And now, we must part. The question is, will you allow me to leave with my life?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nAttack \u2013 You die now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't let you live\u2014not now, not ever.''\nGergis frowned at her answer, but expected it all the same.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''We are what we choose. I will live and die by my choices.<br />Know this\u2014you cannot stop the Order. Even in our deaths, we live on. We are everywhere, now and in the future. It was a pleasure to meet you, Kassandra.''\nGergis drew his sword. Kassandra defeated him with little effort and confirmed he was dead.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nJust go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave, before I change my mind.''\nGergis prepared to leave.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Your baby. Elpidios. He's safe. That much I can tell you.''\nKassandra heaved a sigh of relief.\n*'''Gergis:''' ''It was a pleasure to meet you, Kassandra. The next time we meet will likely be the last.''\n}}\n|-|Compassion.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want to be remembered as someone who helps others in need.''\n*'''Gergis:''' ''Insight. Such wonderful insight. Thank you.<br>And now, we must part.

Such wonderful insight. Thank you.<br />And now, we must part.

I'm sorry.''",

    "General_Description": "'''The City that Cried Wolf''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra travelled throughout [[Makedonia]] to eliminate [[wolves]] that were used by the [[Pactyas (Ancients)|Huntsman]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra inspected the hideout used by [[Darius]] and [[Natakas]], finding one of Darius' notes pinned to the wall. It made several observations about the local wolves.\n*'''Darius' Notes'''<br>''The wolves around the [[Amphipolis|city]] are unusually ravenous, suspiciously so. They've been spotted killing people in Amphipolis at night\u2014a grisly sight. The Huntsman has a strong affinity with beasts. He must be behind these attacks in his hunt for the Eagle Bearer.<br><br>If these wolves were to be taken out, it could cripple the Huntsman's pack.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A few wolves shouldn't be much trouble.''\nKassandra set out for the woods and plains surrounding Amphipolis. \nAt the nesting grounds of the wolves, she killed several of them and eventually deemed her work to be done.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This should send a warning to the Huntsman. I wonder how he'll react to losing his pets.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra slew the wild wolves that the Huntsman had been training for his pack.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Completing this quest changes the dialogue just before battling the [[Pactyas (Ancients)|Huntsman]] during [[Protector of Persia]], as well as deprives him of the alpha wolf that will attack alongside him in that fight.\n*The quest remains available even after completing 'Protector of Persia.'  However, Kassandra will not have any dialogue upon killing the last wolf; the quest will simply complete.",

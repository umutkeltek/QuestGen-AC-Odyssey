What are you doing here?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Rescuing you if you keep your voice down.''\n[[File:ACOD The Spartan Dog 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra escorting the Athenians, fighting Spartan soldiers along the way]]\nShe released the general and the rest of his men. The general led them away from the beach.\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''This way!''\nThey fled into the safety of the hills to the east.\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''Thank you... What do I call you?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Call me Eagle Bearer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Most people call me Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''The what?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You heard me.''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''It's just... I've heard the stories, we all have, but I never thought\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't have time for stories.''\n\n|-|It doesn't matter what you call me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Call me whatever you want. I'm in a hurry.''\n\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD The Spartan Dog 4.png|thumb|250px|The general asking Kassandra for aid]]\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''Right, right... It's these ''mal\u00e1kes'' Spartans. We desperately need to loosen their grip on this region. Will you help us?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''At the moment, I'm not a big fan of the Spartans or their [[Order of the Ancients|friends]].''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''The Persians.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know?''\nThe general nodded.\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''I know those cursed Spartans are richer than they've ever been and should've run out of resources years ago.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was told to give you this.''\n[[File:ACOD The Spartan Dog 5.png|thumb|250px|The general reading the letter from Darius]]\nShe handed him the letter from Darius. He read it.\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''It seems we have common enemies. I can help you and your allies with your plan, but to do it we must kill the Spartan leader here in Messenia.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's so special about this particular Spartan?''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''He's a butcher. He's killed more Athenians than anyone\u2014and he takes joy in it, I tell you. We know his location, but my men and I haven't been able to get close to him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll find it easier with me around.''\nThe general turned to point out the Spartan fleet off the western shore.\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''There. That's his fleet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh... His fleet, you say?''\n[[File:ACOD The Spartan Dog 6.png|thumb|250px|The ''Adrestia'' engaging the Spartan fleet]]\nKassandra sailed the ''[[Adrestia]]'' out to engage the Spartan commander's fleet. Several Athenian ships were engaging the Spartan forces already.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Spartan. With him gone, [[Amorges]]' grip on Messenia will weaken.''\nKassandra sank all of the ships.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So much for that big, bad Spartan butcher.''\nShe sailed back to the Athenian general to report her success.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That Spartan dog is just a memory now.''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''You did it?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Of course I did.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Spartan butcher was no match for me.''\n|-|Thank you for the help.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I couldn't have done it without your help.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''Of course.''<br>''So, about the letter you gave me\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll need you to live up to your end of the bargain if you want the Persians out of Messenia.''\n*'''Athenian General:''' ''You can count on our help when you're ready.''",

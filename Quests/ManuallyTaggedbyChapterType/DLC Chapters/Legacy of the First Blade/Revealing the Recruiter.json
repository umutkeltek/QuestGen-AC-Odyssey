    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra made her way into the wilds near [[Olynthos Fortress]] in search of Darius. [[Ikaros]] spotted him crouching on a cliff amidst the trees west of the fort.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's Darius.''\nShe made her way to Darius to speak to him.  On the way, she noticed dead Spartans concealed in the bushes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone killed these Spartans... and hid them.''\nShe reached the top of the hill and spoke to Darius.\n<tabber>\n|-|Found bodies=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There you are. Those Spartan guards down the hill... Why hide them?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''If Order guards saw their fallen allies, they'd be on high alert. Buys me time.''\n|-|Did not find bodies=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found you.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I'm found when I want to be.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Natakas says you found something. Could it lead to the [[Pactyas (Ancients)|Huntsman]]?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''The Order has been making plans. You want \"the Huntsman\"? Then stick around and help me stop them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm listening.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''One of the Huntsman's lieutenants is in charge of recruitment for the Order in [[Makedonia]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So we locate him and we'll have a lead.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Look for any notes, messages, ledgers\u2014they will tell us where the next meeting is. And do it quietly.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll do it my way.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll rip through that fort and deal with what's to come.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''You lack foresight. But the choice is yours\u2014just get what we need.''\n|-|I'll try to be quiet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do my best not to be seen.''\nDarius was pleased by her answer.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Good.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I'll go down to the village and find out when the meeting is taking place.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When I'm done at the fort, I'll meet you there.''\nThe two parted ways and Kassandra made her way east to the Fortress. Ikaros located many items of note.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There it is!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found it!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's what I'm looking for.''\nKassandra infiltrated the fort and began her hunt.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius said to keep this quiet.''\nShe inspected the garrison commander's quarters and found a note.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Meet me tonight beneath our favorite tree. I need you.\"<br>Hmm... Steamy.''\nA nearby captain carried another message. She assassinated him and claimed the note from his corpse, reading it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"The [[goat]]s shall bleed, and the moths will draw to the flame. The [[snake]] will be reborn. New fangs, new skin, new life.\"<br>Maybe Darius will know what this means.''\nKassandra made her way through the fort to a storage barn on the opposite side. She found the final message of interest.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Food shipment delivered. Village cook has verified contents.\"<br>Ordinary receipt, not helpful.''\nWith all three items in hand, she decided to leave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That should be everything. Time to meet Darius.''\n[[File:ACOD Revealing the Recruiter - Darius Reading Scroll.png|thumb|250px|Darius reading the scroll]]\nKassandra made her way out of the fort and back west to the [[Small farm|farm]] where she had  agreed to meet Darius. He called to her near some burnt sheaves of hay.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Over here.''\nShe handed over the messages, and he began to read them.\n*'''Darius:''' ''How did it go?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Undetected=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Everything went well. No one even knew I was there.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Indeed.''\n|-|Detected=\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI got caught.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They saw me. Security was tight.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''There may be consequences.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLie \u2013 They heard nothing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was fine\u2014''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I could hear you all the way from here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then why ask?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Integrity is important.''\n}}\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you make of those? They don't look like secret messages.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''This note. New fangs? New recruits. And bleeding goats\u2014''\nDarius looked around.\n*'''Darius:''' ''A goat farm, like this one. That's where the meeting will be. The Order uses goat's blood in their initiation rituals.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You know a lot about the Order.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The notes meant nothing to me. Your knowledge of the Order is helpful. What else do you know?''\n|-|You know too much about the Order.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know ''too much'' about the Order.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I don't know enough.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What ''do'' you know?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Darius:''' ''I know the meeting is ''soon''. There's always a signal to draw them in.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There must be more to the note.''\n[[File:ACOD Revealing the Recruiter - Kassandra Darius Investigation.png|thumb|250px|Darius and Kassandra investigate the farm]]\nDarius opened the note once more, and they both studied it.\n*'''Darius:''' ''This part about moths to a flame...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If they use goat farms, they might have been here. We should look around for clues.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''True. Where do you want to start?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That grain storage.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That granary over there. It's small but full, I'm sure people still flock to it like\u2014''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Bees to [[honey]]? I don't think so.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Me neither.''\n(If this was the first choice)\n*'''Darius:''' ''This is about flames and fire. There's something here.''\n(back to choices)\n|-|The wine jars on the rack.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe that rack of wine jars over there by the house... There could be goat's blood stored in them for the Order ritual.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''We already solved the goat part.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right.''\n(If this was the first choice)\n*'''Darius:''' ''This is about flames and fire. There's something here.''\n(back to choices)\n|-|Those pyres of hay.=\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFirst or second choice=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those pyres of hay... There are soot marks at the base.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''What of it?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThird choice=\n*'''Darius:''' ''Look. Soot and ash.''\nThey inspected the pyres.\n*'''Darius:''' ''They must have used some of these pyres in their last meeting.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're onto something. This does seem suspicious.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Take a closer look.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're wrong.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those? If they used hay for the fire, there wouldn't be any left\u2014''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Look closer.''\n}}\n}}\n</tabber>\nRegardless, the two knelt down to inspect the soot marks around the pyres of hay.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Somebody has been burning hay here. The flames are the signal.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Which means night is the only time they can meet because\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Moths to a flame.''\nThey stood up.\n*'''Darius:''' ''That's right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We just have to wait for the meeting to start.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''There's another [[goat farm]] nearby, across the bridge.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good. I'll meet you there at nightfall.''\nDarius took his leave. Eventually, Kassandra joined him in the bushes near the yard of the farm.\n<tabber>\n|-|Met Darius during the day.=\n*'''Darius:''' ''I found a place to watch the meeting. We'll wait there.''\nThey made their way to the observation point and waited until nightfall.\n|-|Met Darius at nightfall.=\n*'''Darius:''' ''The meeting is soon. Come.''\nThey made their way to the observation point.\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Revealing the Recruiter - Bubares Briefing.png|thumb|250px|Bubares talking to the recruits]]\n\nThe meeting began. The two observed the recruiter speaking to three individuals at the farm.\n*'''Bubares:''' ''The Huntsman will be pleased with this turnout.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''The Recruiter.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Undetected at Olynthos Fortress=\n*'''Bubares:''' ''To the matter at hand\u2014the Eagle Bearer! Your mission is simple.''\nBubares raised his hands for emphasis.\n*'''Bubares:''' ''Bring me her head!''\n|-|Detected at Olynthos Fortress=\n*'''Bubares:''' ''There's been a disturbance at the Olynthos Fortress. Artabanus must be behind this.''\nKassandra turned to Darius.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Artabanus?''\nDarius remained silent.\n*'''Bubares:''' ''Your mission is to find the Eagle Bearer, but if you bring me both of them\u2014All the better.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Darius:''' ''I'll flank them. Don't let him get away.''\n<tabber>\n|-|We should stick together.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We shouldn't split up. Don't\u2014''\n|-|I'll get him myself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need your help. Just\u2014''\n</tabber>\nBefore Kassandra could finish, Darius had already disappeared.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka.\nKassandra stood up to decide her plan of action.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait for the meeting to end... Or go in now? Where did Darius go?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Attacked right away=\nKassandra attacked the recruiter and his guards.\n*'''Bubares:''' ''There you are. I'll take your head myself, Eagle Bearer. The Huntsman will be pleased.''\nKassandra eliminated Bubares and his men.\n|-|Attacked after the meeting ended=\n*'''Bubares:''' ''The numbers here are sufficient. But the Huntsman needs more. Drink and consider yourself one of us! You will play an important part in restoring balance and order to your [[Makedonia|homeland]]. The Eagle Bearer ''alone'' is at fault for Makedonia's woes. The blood, the bodies! Tragic. So very tragic. The Order is the answer. We will rid your lands of this [[Tainted One]]. With her gone, Makedonia's balance will be restored. We've drawn the Eagle Bearer to Makedonia. Now go! Find her.''\nThe new recruits departed. The recruiter's guards spoke to him.\n*'''Captain:''' ''Recruitment is going well, sir. But most of them can't fight. They are villagers, farmers\u2014They stand no chance agaisnt the Eagle Bearer. You saw what she did at the village we burned.''\n*'''Bubares:''' ''Then you understand why no price is too high to stop her. Now go find the Eagle Bearer instead of questioning the Huntsman's orders.''\nThe guards left the area.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There he goes. ''All'' alone. Now's my chance. I can't wait for Darius.''\nKassandra sneaked behind Bubares and assassinated him.\n</tabber>\nKassandra recovered a scroll from his body and read it aloud.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Another note. \"I expect good news about the recruitment. Report to me at the lake.\" The ''Huntsman.\n[[File:ACOD Revealing the Recruiter - Darius Return.png|thumb|250px|Darius appearing to Kassandra]]\nDarius leaned against the building listening to her. He announced his presence.\n*'''Darius:''' ''A lake. Interesting.''\n(If players asked \"Where were you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where were you hiding?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''Closer than you'd have thought. You were never in any real danger.''\n:(Detected at Olynthos Fortress \u2013 \"Who is Artabanus?\")\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Huntsman's lieutenant mentioned an... Artabanus. Who's that?''\n:Darius avoided her gaze and frowned before replying.\n:*'''Darius:''' ''A dead man.''\n(If players chose \"I thought we were working together.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You left. ''Why''?''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I needed to be sure you weren't with the Order.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You still suspected me.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''And you've never questioned my relationship to the Order?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I have wondered about your relationship to the Order.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's true I've had my suspicions. You identified the coded note immediately and knew of their rituals and ways.''\n|-|I wouldn't have left you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is ''not'' the same. I thought I had back up.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Darius:''' ''I know you're clean, and we've got our answers.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The note said that the Huntsman is near a lake.''\n*'''Darius:''' ''I have other leads to follow up on. And I'm sure Natakas has more for you.''\nDarius departed the farm.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever Darius is hiding, I'll find it.''",

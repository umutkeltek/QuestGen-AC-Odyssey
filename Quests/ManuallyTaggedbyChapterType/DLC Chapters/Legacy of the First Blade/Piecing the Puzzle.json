We know he commands an army of animals, but [[Makedonia]]'s a huge\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll follow up on the other leads.''\n([[Revealing the Recruiter]] complete)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've killed the [[Bubares|Recruiter]], your father was there too. He didn't have much to say about the Huntsman apart from the fact that he's near a lake.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''And my father? Where is he\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He left to continue his search. Don't worry Natakas.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Easy for you to say.''\n([[Whimpers Through the Fog]] complete)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That contact of yours in the [[Therme Wetlands|wetland]] led me to a madman. I believe it might've been the Huntsman himself.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''If you're back here looking the way you are, he must've gotten away.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He won't the next time.''\n\n(All three quests complete)<br>\nHaving collected all of the clues she could, Kassandra decided to return to [[Natakas]] to discuss her findings.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should go back to Natakas with these clues. He might know what to make of them.''\nKassandra reached the hideout and spoke with Natakas.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''You're back. What did you find?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Clues. Maybe you'll know what to do with them. One, the Huntsman is supposed to be waiting in the [[Forest of the Huntsman|forest]]. Two, he's surrounded by animals. And three, he's by a lake.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I think I know where that might be. There's a crack in a cliff face that leads to a [[Huntsman's Glade|glade]]. If it's where I think it is...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go!''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I can't, not yet. This is the Huntsman. We've suffered at his blades for years. Father should be there to see him die. I'll find him and join you at the glade.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"Time to kill the Huntsman.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the Huntsman's in this glade, I won't be able to wait for you and Darius.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I'll be there.''",

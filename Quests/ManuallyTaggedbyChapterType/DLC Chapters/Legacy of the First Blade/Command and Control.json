    "General_Description": "'''Command and Control''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra sought out the ''[[helot]]s'' imprisoned in [[Aipeia]] to learn the identity of the [[Harpagos|commander]] working for the [[Order of Dominion]], in order to kill him and disrupt their activities in the city.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "With the help of [[Ikaros]], Kassandra scouted out the [[Leader House, Messenia|Leader House]] for the helots she needed to rescue. She found all three of them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see him.<br>There he is!<br>Found him!''\nKassandra infiltrated the Leader House and made her way to each of the prisoners. From out of sight, she overheard the soldiers chastising the prisoner wearing gray.\n*'''Soldier:''' ''Idiots... Stealing our supplies again. When will you learn not to mess with us?''\nKassandra dispatched the nearby guards and freed the prisoner.  She made her way around the back of the house and freed the brown-clothed prisoner up the stairs under the awning. She also made her way into the inner garden to free the prisoner wearing a red toga.\n*'''Soldier:''' ''Stop your whining. Stop your crying.''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra escorting the prisoner out of the camp]]\nKassandra cleared the way off of the grounds and released the prisoner. With all of the prisoners free, Kassandra escorted them safely to a building near the docks at the southern part of the city. She went around the room talking to them, but the first was unhelpful.\n*'''Helot 1:''' ''Thank the gods! I'm alive!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can you tell me where the helot [[Rhode]] is?''\n*'''Helot 1:''' ''Who's that? I'm free now, I don't care!''\nThe second helot was just as unhelpful.\n*'''Helot 2:''' ''Thank you, thank you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know where I can find the ''helot'' called Rhode?''\n*'''Helot 2:''' ''I know nothing!''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 4.png|thumb|250px|The helot revealing Rhode's location to Kassandra]]\nThe third helot, who wore the red toga, was much more talkative.\n*'''Helot 3:''' ''You saved me. Thank you,'' misthios!\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you seen the helot named Rhode?''\n*'''Helot 3:''' ''Yes, she was taken to the [[Aipeia agora|center]] of Aipeia. I heard she's going to meet her end there.''\nThe helot took his leave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The town center. I should hurry.''\nKassandra left the building and made for the town center. There, she heard the soldiers passing judgment on Rhode.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''You're making this worse for yourself!''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''You ''made'' us steal the food. There's not enough to go around.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Shut up! It's not the first time you've been caught, and this time it's going to be the last.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''At least I'll go with a stomach full of bread!''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 6.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra negotiating for Rhode's release]]\nAs Kassandra approached the platform, Rhode spit in the soldier's face, who responded by punching her to the floor.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Shut your mouth. That's what you get for taking what isn't yours. Your death shall be a warning to them all!''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''I don't care who the food belongs to. We were hungry!''\nKassandra walked onto the platform to confront the soldier.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''If you're here for the show, I think you'll have a clearer view from down there with the rest. Who are you?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Attack \u2013 I'm your worst nightmare.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm angry, I'm impatient, and I'm out of time. So, I'm not here to talk.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''What do you mean? You want to kill this woman too?''\nThe soldier laughed at his own joke.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not in the mood for mercy, so I suggest whoever wants to keep their limbs leave now.''\nShe addressed the soldiers waiting below. A few took her advice and walked off.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Fine. Cowards, leave your honor at the door and run home with your tails between your legs. As for the brave\u2014get the ''misthios''!''\nThey drew their weapons.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''You're gonna get what you came for!''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Bread for the people, bread for the children!''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Should've cut out your tongue, thief.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Too bad!''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''What are you doing here? You said I could leave if I wanted to.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''I'll have to punish you now!''\n|-|I'm here to talk.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here for this woman.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Her? She got caught stealing from the kitchens again. We're under strict instructions from the commander to ensure that stops today.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need her alive. Release her, and no one gets hurt.''\nThe soldier glanced down, considered her words, and smirked.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''There's a price for everything, ''misthios''. We'll need [[drachma]]e to replenish our food supplies.''\nWhile he dictated terms, more soldiers surrounded Kassandra.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll pay. [300]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll pay for her.''\nThe soldier chuckled.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Well then, it seems that I forgot about the extra cost for our troubles. Torture is hard work, you know. Double it, and I'll give her to you.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''[[Hades]]! Don't give him a single drachma!''\nThe soldier punched Rhode back to the ground.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Shut up.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll pay double. [600]=\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 7.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra paid off the soldiers to release Rhode]]\nKassandra scowled and tossed him a coin pouch.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine, take your payment.''\nThe soldier caught the pouch, but he continued his greedy streak.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Actually, there's\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't. Push. It.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''OK, OK! Take this filthy ''mal\u00e1kas'' and go.''\nKassandra gestured for Rhode to follow, who stopped to glare at the soldier before leaving with Kassandra.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nAttack \u2013 I'll pay with my blade.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough. I'm taking her... along with your heads.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Yeah! Get 'em!''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''You picked the wrong side. Get the ''misthios!\nThey drew their weapons.\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''You're gonna get what you came for!''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Bread for the people, bread for the children!''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''Should've cut out your tongue, thief.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Too bad!''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''What are you doing here? You said I could leave if I wanted to.''\n*'''Greek Soldier:''' ''I'll have to punish you now!''\nKassandra defeated the guards.\n}}\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nAttack \u2013 You'll pay.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough.

Thanks, ''misthios''! Good thing you came along. Bye!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait! I'm looking for the Commander. I was told you know something about him.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''The Commander... Oh, I know him alright. Brings back fond memories. I used to work for that ''mal\u00e1kas.\n(Asked \"What is he like?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This Commander sounds terrible.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''He's ruthless, ''misthios''. He would work us till our hands were red and raw, and we'd bleed and cry until dawn. Even the children weren't spared. Which is why I have to pinch food when I can. It's never enough.''\n(Asked \"How did you get caught?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were lucky, I arrived just in time. How did you get caught?''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''They caught me stealing one loaf of bread and sentenced me to death. So what if I stole from them ten other times? It's too much, too severe!''\n(Chose \"Tell me where the Commander is.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Point me to the Commander, and I'll stick my blade through his throat.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''You're looking to kill him? Great!''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 9.png|thumb|250px|The children suffering as a result of the Order's rule]]\nKassandra raised an eyebrow.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Things are happening in Messenia, ''misthios''. Look at how we're suffering... How the children suffer. There must be something better out there for them. I have a plan to get the children away from here. My [[Pebble (helot)|son]]... and the others. Help the children, and I'll help you.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll help the children.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do it, but you better tell me where the Commander is.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''So kind of you, ''misthios''! I promise, you'll find your target. Just don't gut him in front of the children.''\n|-|I'll help for a price.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help, but it'll cost you.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''What? You would ask for drachmae in a time of crisis such as this?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A ''misthios'' has to eat, too.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Fine, I'll give you whatever I have. Mostly bread crumbs.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's your plan to get the children out?''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''We have a fisherman nearby who is being paid handsomely for the job. We need to take the children to his boat near the docks, but we need to leave soon. Time is almost up.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lead the way.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Follow me!''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 11.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra with Rhode and the children]]\nRhode led Kassandra to the tents on the outskirts of the city, where the children awaited.\n*'''Pebble:''' Mater''!''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Hello my little Pebble. No time to talk, we need to go\u2014now!''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''Who's this?''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''A ''misthios'' friend! She's going to help us get out of here.''\nRhode led the children and Kassandra back through the city towards the port.\n*'''Pebble:''' ''All right everyone. ''Mater'' says to follow the ''misthios''. Stay in a group so we don't get lost.''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Stay in a group so we don't get lost!''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''This is serious!''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 12.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra escorting Rhode and the kids to a safe spot]]\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''Do you have a hero name, misthios?''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''A hero name is a code name only the greatest, bestest, heroes have. It's usually a combination of a cool animal and the weather.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Tell her your hero names, children.''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''Mine's Wolfstorm.''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Mine's Sharklightning!''\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''Mine's...''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''He's Chickenrain!''\nPebble and Sharklightning giggled at the name while Chickenrain sulked.\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''I didn't choose that name! I hate you both!''\nAs they neared the port, a man dressed in [[Order of the Ancients|Order]] armor blocked their path with a contingent of guards.\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''Look who we have here.''\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''Ahh!''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Scary man!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stay back, children.''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 13.png|thumb|250px|Harpagos confronting the ''misthios'']]\nKassandra stepped in front between the commander and the children.\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''I knew I would find you here, Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You caught me.''\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''They were right, you're always at the center of the chaos. Now, why don't you step aside and let me do my job? I'll deal with you\u2014''\nHe looked menacingly at Rhode. Kassandra adjusted her armor, ready for a fight.\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''And ''you'' after I take the children away. They have work to do.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll deal with you now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why wait? I've been looking for you\u2014thanks for sparing me the trouble. I can deal with you now.''\nRhode turned to lead the children away.\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''Let's not waste any time then. I'll make an example out of your screams.''\n|-|Let the children go.=\nKassandra signaled Rhode to lead the children away.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave the children out of this.''\nHarpagos laughed.\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''I'm going to have fun watching you drown in your own blood. Time to die!''\n</tabber>\nThe guards engaged Kassandra, and she drew her weapons.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Cover your eyes, children! Don't look!''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 14.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra dealing with Harpagos and his guards]]\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''Make him pay! Impale him! Cut off his head! Roar!''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Language.''\n*'''Commander Harpagos:''' ''Shut up! You children are too noisy. I'll make sure you all learn to hold your tongue when I'm done.''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''He doesn't look very strong. Poke his eyes out!''\nKassandra killed Harpagos and his entire guard. Rhode urged the children onwards.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Go to the cove. Hurry, kids! A boat is waiting.''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''You need a hero name, ''misthios!\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why don't you choose one for me.''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Hmm...''\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''Oh, oh! Eagle something! Since she has an eagle!''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''Eaglethunder!''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Perfect!''\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''You're one of us now!''\nThe group finally arrived at the cove.\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''Yay! You did it! You defeated the bad guys!''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Eaglethunder! Eaglethunder! Eaglethunder!''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''That was super amazing!''\n*'''Rhode:''' Misthios''! You did it.''\nRhode turned to the fisherman, who nodded to acknowledge their agreement. She knelt before her daughter and her voice broke.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''It's time for you to go, little Pebble.''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''You're... not coming?''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 16.png|thumb|250px|Rhode proposing to send the children away]]\n*'''Rhode:''' ''I can't. I have to stay here and work hard so I can visit you one day.''\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''No... No! Where's my ''pater''? Where's my ''mater''?''\n*'''Pebble:''' ''I can't be without you, ''mater''. Who will hug me when I have a bad dream?''\n*'''Rhode:''' Misthios'', I\u2014I'm not sure. Now that we're here, I don't know if I can bear to send them away.''\nChickenrain began to cry and turned away.\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Don't make us go, please.''\n<tabber>\n|-|The children should stay.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Children shouldn't be separated from their parents. You should stay.''\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''I get to stay?''\n*'''Pebble:''' Mater'', we'll be together!''\nSharklightning ran towards her father.\n*'''Helot Child (girl):''' ''Pater! Pater!''\nRhode approached Kassandra.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''I'm happy my Pebble is staying, but is it the right choice?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It would be cruel to tear these families apart.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''It might be even more cruel to subject them to a life in Messenia. I don't know if I'll be able to protect them.''\n|-|The children should go.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have to go. Messenia is crawling with danger\u2014it's not safe for children.''\n*'''Helot Child (boy):''' ''But what about our parents? What will happen to them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They want what's best for you. Now go, the boat is waiting.''\n[[File:ACOD Command and Control 17.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Rhode looked on as the children were sent away]]\nRhode knelt down and clasped her daughter's elbows.\n*'''Rhode:''' Chaire'', my Pebble.''\nThe boat carrying the children disappeared past the horizon as Kassandra and Rhode looked on.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Things will be better for them out there.''\n*'''Rhode:''' ''You're right. If the children stayed, I don't know if we'd be able to protect them. I hope they have a better life ahead... Better than we could have given them.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We will always fight for our children.''\nRhode turned towards the sea.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''Always.''\nShe turned back to Kassandra.\n*'''Rhode:''' ''And you got your commander. Thank you, ''misthios''. May our paths cross again.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra saved three helots from their captors at the [[Leader House, Messenia|Leader House]] in [[Aipeia]]. She then rushed towards the execution platform in town to rescue [[Rhode]]. Together with Rhode, Kassandra tried to bring the children of Aipeia to safety, including [[Pebble]], daughter of Rhode. Kassandra assassinated Commander [[Harpagos]] at the docks when he tried to stop them. Eventually Kassandra had to choose between sending the children away or letting them stay.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*If the player frees Rhode the violent way, there doesn't seem to be any difference in dialogue for any of the \"Attack\" choices, even though there may seem to be at first.  The number of guards marked to kill for the next objective is the same, and guards that \"ran away\" will claim the protagonist has come after them anyway, even if the fighting is kept confined to the execution platform.",

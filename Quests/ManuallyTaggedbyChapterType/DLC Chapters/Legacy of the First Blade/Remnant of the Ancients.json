    "Section_Description": "Kassandra visited the [[Artisan Smith|artisan]] [[blacksmith]] in [[Kirrha]], [[Phokis]] to find a way to repair [[Amorges]]' [[sword]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' ''Amorges is dealt with, and I have his blade. But it's useless... Broken, and the metal is strange. I should find a blacksmith.\nWhile passing through the town of [[Kirrha]] in Phokis, Kassandra spotted a smith at [[Sargon]]'s [[Oikos of the Olympians]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' The Oikos of the Olympians has a blacksmith known for his skill in working rare metals. I should take the sword there.''\nKassandra travelled to the Oikos of the Olympians in Phokis. She spoke with an artisan smith.\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''[[Kopis]] or ''{{Wiki|basket|kophinos}}''\u2014what do you need?''\nKassandra took out the broken blade and showed it to the blacksmith.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you seen anything like this before?''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''[[Jupiter|Zeus]]' balls! Do you know what this is?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Broken?''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''It's [[adamant]]ine! This stuff is priceless! And I don't mind telling you I'm the one man in the islands who knows how to properly work it. I'll need more adamantine to fix it, though. A lot more.''\nKassandra nodded and took out several [[Order of the Ancients medallion|Image of the Ancients]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Will this help? The metal looks similar.''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''What the\u2014where in [[Hades]] are you getting this stuff? No, I don't want to know.''\nKassandra handed over more necklaces to the blacksmith.\n:If Kassandra had insufficient metal, the following brief scene played out.\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is this enough to repair the sword?''\n:*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''I wish I could say yes, but then I'd be lying... Bring me more, and I'll make you a sword fit for a [[Greek mythology|god]].''\n:Kassandra left to collect more necklaces and returned after killing every member of the [[Order of the Ancients]].\n:*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''You're back! You got it, didn't you? I can smell Adamantine, and you smell good!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here. Don't tell me you need more, because I've run out of necks to cut it from.''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''There's real passion behind your words, I can feel it. I'm personally glad to say that these will do. The blood on them is a nice touch, by the way. Helps with the quenching.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do what I can.''\n*'''Artisan Smith:''' ''Wait here. This won't take long.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra collected the Image of the Ancients from all the members of the [[Order of Hunters]], [[Order of the Storm]], and [[Order of Dominion]], smelting the adamantine the necklaces were made of to repair [[The Sword of Kings]].",

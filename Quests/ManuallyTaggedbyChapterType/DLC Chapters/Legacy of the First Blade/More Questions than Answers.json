    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra walked through the hideout after [[Darius]] and [[Natakas]] left.  She still had questions and decided Natakas was the one most likely to provide answers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should find Natakas...''\nShe left the hideout and passed by Darius at the campfire overlooking the forest.\n*'''Darius:''' ''Natakas has gone out hunting, if you're looking for him.''\n[[File:ACOD_LotFBH_More_Questions_than_Answers_-_Kassandra_and_Natakas_on_hill.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding Natakas near the edge of a hill]]\nKassandra made her way to a hill where Natakas overlooked the hunting grounds.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Kassandra. What are you doing here?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was going to ask you the same.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I find doing something practical helps me get my thoughts together.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You like hunting.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I do. There's deer here usually.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You don't look like the hunting type.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Everytime I've seen you, you're trying to save lives, not end them.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I don't see an issue if it's done with balance in mind and respect for the animal.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a nice idea.''\n|-|You must take after your father.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're anything like Darius, I bet you're good with a bow.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I do all right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Modest.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I was just about to start. Would you like to join me?''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll hunt with you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like that. It'd be nice.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Let's see how good you really are. How many deer do you think you can get?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's find out...''\nKassandra and Natakas made their way down the hill.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''The deer are usually around here...''\nKassandra drew her bow and felled a deer.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Nice shot.''\nShe felled another.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius is good in a fight. He must train a lot.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Never misses a day. He doesn't know his age...''\nKassandra felled a third deer.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your father is a man of few words.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''And you caught him on a more talkative day.''\nShe hunted another one.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Another one!''\nUpon felling the fifth deer, Natakas heard a noise.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Shh! Did you hear that?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Follow me. Stay quiet.'' There!\nKassandra followed him until he pointed out the source of the noise. Natakas commented on their new quarry.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''He's tricky...''\nNatakas crouched on a small cliff under a tree.  Kassandra crouched down beside him.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Shh... ''\n[[File:ACOD_LotFBH_More_Questions_than_Answers_-_Kassandra_and_Natakas_observing_a_boar.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Natakas observing a wild boar]]\nHe looked directly at her.\n*'''Natakas:''' Trust'' me.''\nHe turned her attention to the animal below them.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Look...''\nThe animal was not a deer, but a [[Wild boar|boar]], a rare sight in [[Makedonia]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A boar? In Makedonia?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Almost unheard of. Delicious.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I love boar.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It is...''\n|-|Boar is disgusting.=\nKassandra grimaced.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They taste... Filthy animals.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Keep quiet... It'll hear you.''\nThey stood carefully and Kassandra drew her bow once more.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I can almost taste it...''\nThe boar was tougher than the deer, but Kassandra slew it all the same and harvested its meat.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's this?''\n[[File:ACOD_LotFBH_More_Questions_than_Answers_-_Kassandra_and_Natakas_camping.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Natakas at the campsite]]\nKassandra and Natakas returned to camp, where night had fallen. Natakas prepared the meal from the boar meat Kassandra hunted.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''That makes  ''everything'' better.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Loved boar meat earlier=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're an amazing cook, Natakas. Good enough for the gods.''\n|-|Hated boar meat earlier=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I usually hate boar. But what you've managed to do here\u2014it's fit for the gods.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Natakas:''' ''It's an old family recipe. My grandmother would be happy to hear.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should all indulge as gods when we can.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Us? Gods?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm a god.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Speak for yourself. I'm already a god.''\nNatakas stood and smiled at her boast.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''There ''is'' something special about you. Everyone can see it, obviously. But no one, not even you, can fully tell what it is.''\n|-|We can all dream.=\nKassandra stood up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We could pretend, for a while. In truth, I'm a ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. I hunt for food, like you. I work for [[drachma]]e, like you. I live on the road. Like you.''\nNatakas stood up as well.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Yet, I've seen the Eagle Bearer. Your deeds are worthy of the stories.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD_LotFBH_More_Questions_than_Answers_-_Kassandra_overlooking_hill.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Natakas looking over the hill]]\nKassandra turned to the edge of the cliff, looking out at the nighttime scenery.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With all that's happened in Makedonia... I guess you can't stay here.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I don't know. We always run. Ever since I was a child. My mother would find a way\u2014no matter if it were by the side of a road or in a cave somewhere\u2014she'd find a way to keep us warm. Safe. Like we had a home. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's gone now?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Years ago. Same with my siblings. The [[Order of the Ancients|Order]]. The last time we saw them was the last time I saw my sister [[Neema]] alive. What about you? What about your past?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm much like you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I never knew a true home, either. I grew up fending for myself, hoping there'd be a place out there where I'd feel, as you said, warm. I haven't found it.''\nNatakas looked sad to hear this.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And anyway, I don't think it exists.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 I don't have a family.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't have a family. Not one worth considering anyway.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Natakas:''' ''We're shaped by our pasts, not defined by them.''\nThe two continued to stand watch overlooking the cliff well into the night. The next morning, Kassandra discussed the situation with [[Barnabas]].\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''They're Persians, you say?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius claims to have killed King Xerxes himself.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Ha! You don't believe that, do you?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I believe Darius killed Xerxes.=\nKassandra smiled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do believe it. Of all the lies he could tell, that's one of the most unbelievable.''\nBarnabas smiled as well.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''A lie worthy of [[Dolos]] himself.''\n|-|I don't believe Darius killed Xerxes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't believe him. It's too wild of a claim, even for me.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''And yet we've heard wilder claims that turned out true.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD_LotFBH_More_Questions_than_Answers_-_Kassandra_and_Barnabas.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Barnabas discuss Darius]]\nKassandra exhaled with exasperation.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't know what to believe anymore. Darius says the Order of the Ancients are here to find me. The note he found mentioned [[Tainted One|others]]\u2014''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''There are others like you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I believe him, there are. But how do I know that Darius isn't working for the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]], or in the Order himself?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You say he's heard you're a great warrior. Maybe he wants to use you to help him fight against this Order.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If he's not one of them.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''The simple question is, do you trust him?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I trust Darius.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I trust Darius. He's mysterious, but not a liar.''\n|-|I don't trust Darius.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's too much left unsaid. So, no, I don't trust him.''\n|-|I don't trust anybody.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's impossible for me to truly trust anyone.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Ouch.''\nBarnabas smiled at her unintentional deprecation.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Except you, Barnabas.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''It sounds like you need to go back to these Persians if you want to know what's really going on.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius ''is'' hiding something, that much is clear.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Then be careful. Make sure whatever he is hiding isn't a trap.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be as careful as I always am.''\nShe tapped Barnabas on the shoulder.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''That's what I'm afraid of.''\nBarnabas took his leave of Kassandra.",

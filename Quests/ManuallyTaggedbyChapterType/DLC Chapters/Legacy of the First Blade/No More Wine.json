    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra visited Natakas' memorial.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Our [[Elpidios|baby]]'s safe. Your [[Darius|father]] too. It's only you I couldn't... I never got the chance to say goodbye.<br />There are some things I want to get get for you. This time, I'll be back.''\n\nKassandra returned to the cliff northeast of Dyme, where Natakas had dropped his mother's charm into the water. Ikaros spotted it below the waves.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is it.''\nKassandra walked to the edge of the cliff and reminisced.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We used to love this place. Now...''\nShe dove into water and recovered the charm.\n<tabber>\n|-|Romance only=\nKassandra returned to the surface and took a deep breath of fresh air.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Natakas' charm! To hold it again... It's precious to me.''\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra returned to the island near the [[Shipwreck of Nestor]], south of [[Messenia]]. Ikaros spotted the item she sought.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the place.''\nShe found Elpidios' baby blanket near the cliff where she met with his [[Darius II of Persia|caretaker]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Our baby's blanket. What a relief it was to find him. Now he's gone away as well. But we have this to remind us...''\nShe picked up the blanket.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There you are. Still here, just as he left you. But he's gone.''\n(or) (Final item)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now everything's done, I should visit Natakas' grave in [[Achaia]]. It's time to say goodbye.''\n\nKassandra returned to the [[Rock Arch]] in [[Makedonia]]. Ikaros called out the entrance to the former [[Tomb Hideout|hideout]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm where I need to be.''\nKassandra set foot inside the entrance, and the memories came rushing to her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This was the beginning. Natakas, how could we have known?''\nKassandra followed the stairs into the main chamber.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Darius and Natakas left so much behind.''\nKassandra recovered Natakas' [[Natakas' Hunting Bow|bow]] on the ground.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here's your bow, where you left it. You'll want it back.''\n(or) (Final item)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now everything's done, I should visit Natakas' grave in [[Achaia]]. It's time to say goodbye.''\n\nKassandra returned to Natakas' memorial. She knelt before it.\n<tabber>\n|-|Romance=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These are ours. A reminder of our time together.''\nKassandra placed Natakas' charm and the baby blanket on the memorial and fought back her sadness.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I miss you. Your laugh and your... infuriating insight. I'll never forget you, Natakas.''\nShe looked up and gazed out at the [[Istion Valley|valley]] the two of them had called home.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Trust me.''\n|-|No romance=\nKassandra uttered no words. She simply placed Natakas' charm and the baby blanket on the memorial, then looked out at the valley and smiled.\n</tabber>",

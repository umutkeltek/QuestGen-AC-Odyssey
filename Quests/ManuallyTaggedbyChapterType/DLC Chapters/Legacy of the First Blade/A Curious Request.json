She infiltrated the camp and began dispatching the guards within, then overheard a woman tied up in a nearby tent out to her for help.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I'm over here! I need your help breaking out!''\nKassandra made quick work of the remaining guards and untied the woman.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Let's get the fuck out of here!''\nKassandra escorted the woman to safety.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''[[Mercenary|Misthios]], thank you! Those fuckers thought they could hold me, but they just didn't understand. No prison can hold me. Nobody can hold me down. Not even that stupid [[Order of the Ancients|Order]]...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right...''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''They were ruining my favorite wine-drinking view with all their mercenaries. No one wants to see trashy mercenaries around their homes.<br>No offense.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''None taken.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''You know, I overheard them say they had brought another three mercenaries here. Can you believe that?''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I can kill some mercenaries for you.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help get your view back.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Fuck yes! There's three mercenaries, remember. Once they're gone, I'd love to share a cup of wine with you in my spot. Even if you are a misthios yourself.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like that.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra freed Ide and escorted her out of the camp to safety. The old woman requested her help in eliminating several mercenaries.",

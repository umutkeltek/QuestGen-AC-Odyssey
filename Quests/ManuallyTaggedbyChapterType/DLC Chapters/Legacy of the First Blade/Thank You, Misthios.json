Why did you have to kill the [[Pactyas (Ancients)|Huntsman]], the'' malakas ''responsible for burning my village to embers?! We were fine being helplessly vengeful! I, Aiantides the Proud, will never be indebted to anyone. I hid the treasure among the rocks lined up like the constellation {{Wiki|Sagitta}} along the [[Achaia]]n shore. Find it and cease your benevolent deeds\u2014I have nothing left to offer you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Aiantides the Proud. What did I do now to deserve your gifts, friend?''\n[[File:ACOD Thank You, Misthios 1.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the package]]\nKassandra travelled to the rocks at the Achaian shoreline in the [[Poseidon's Wrath]] region. [[Ikaros]] located the gift near the wreck of a ship.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Found it!''\nShe claimed the gift.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Exactly where Aiantides said it'd be.''\nShe sensed a man walk up behind her.\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''There you are, ''mal\u00e1ka''!''\nKassandra drew her [[Spear of Leonidas]] and turned to face him.\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''Whoa, whoa! Wait, it's me!''\nRecognition dawned on Kassandra's face.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Aiantides...?''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''The ''Proud''!''\n<tabber>\n|-|It's nice to meet you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Finally, Aiantides, we meet. It's good to see you.''\n|-|I could've killed you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was a dangerous way to introduce yourself, Aiantides.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''You should have seen your face, Eagle Bearer.''\nHe chuckled, but then immediately turned serious.\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''But no! That's not why I'm here. You! Why can't you just leave me alone?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did I do now? Save your step-sister's cows?''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''My aunt was among the stranded people you saved from the [[Teichos of Herakles|fortress]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've got to be kidding\u2014''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''And now I don't have anything left to reward you. My pockets are dry, my house empty! I've come here to tell you that I, Aiantides the ''Proud'', who shall never be indebted to anyone, will owe you, Eagle Bearer, a\u2014''favor.\n<tabber>\n|-|You owe me nothing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, no. You've done enough. You don't owe me anything.''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''Don't make this harder than it is! Tell me. What is it you need done?''\n|-|I deserve a favor.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right, I've done so much for you. I accept your favor.''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''Excellent! So tell me. What is it you need?''\n</tabber>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|\ud83e\udd1d Work for me on my ship.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Join my crew and work on the ''[[Adrestia]]''.''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''No, no. I have a family to take care of. Something else. Anything!''\n(Back to choices)\n|-|Find some code books for me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get some code books from the Tempest. Find them for me.''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''(scoffs) What do I look like to you? A thief? No, something else.''\n(Back to choices)\n|-|Kill the Tempest for me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's a powerful commander here in Achaia that I need killed\u2014[[Phila|the Tempest]].''\n*'''Aiantides:''' Murder''? You ask ''murder'' of me?! Unacceptable! Ask for something else.''\n(Back to choices)\n|-|Kill some mercenaries for me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There are mercenaries trying to kill me. Take care of them.''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''I'm not fighter. Look at me! I owe you a favor, not my life. There must be something else.''\n(Back to choices)\n|-|Leave \u2013 Just leave me alone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know what, just leave me alone. That would help\u2014a lot.''\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''Fine! But this isn't over, Eagle Bearer. I know we will see each other again.''\n</tabber>\nAiantides turned away.\n*'''Aiantides:''' ''Then I shall redeem my honor! You will ask something of me, I'm sure of it.''\nAiantides walked off. Kassandra lightly shook her head and rolled her eyes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Unbelievable. I hope I don't run into him again.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra recovered the reward near the [[Sunken Temple of Demeter]], getting the chance to meet Aiantides himself.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "This quest will be available if players have finished the previous quests that involve the character Aiantides, \"[[Thank You, Mal\u00e1ka!|Thank You, ''Mal\u00e1ka''!]]\" and \"[[Again, Mal\u00e1ka?!|Again, ''Mal\u00e1ka''?!]]\". The number of favors players can ask of Aiantides depends on which quests have been completed. If, for example, they have already found the mercenaries who hunted them in \"[[Knives in the Dark]]\", found the code books in \"[[Tides of War]]\", and killed The Tempest in \"[[Leviathan's Maw]]\", the only dialogue options available are to recruit Aiantides or tell him to leave. If these quests have instead not been done and the player runs through all three payback options which Aiantides rejects, the protagonist will automatically state the \"Just leave me alone\" option and dismiss him.",

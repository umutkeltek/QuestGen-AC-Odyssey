    "Section_Description": "Kassandra travelled to [[Potidaia]] after receiving a mysterious letter.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra received a letter.\n*'''Letter Addressed to a Misthios:'''<br>''To any one who read this, huge forces are closing in and innocents are dying. We will pay whatever we have. Come to Potidaia in [[Makedonia]].''\nKassandra sailed to Makedonia aboard the ''[[Adrestia]]''. She docked at Potidaia and stepped onto the docks with [[Barnabas]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are we that desperate? We're helping somebody move?''\n[[File:ACOD LotFB - The Horsemen Cometh - Man on Fire.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Barnabas spotting a man on fire]]\nAs they were conversing, a [[Natakas|man]] eyed them from afar before walking away.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''What? The guy's got a lot of stuff! Work is work. And a few extra [[drachma]]e never hurt anybody. Sometimes even the simplest things can be worthy of our attention.''\nThey spotted several injured villagers and a man running while on fire.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That is much more worthy of my attention, Barnabas.''\nBarnabas returned to the ''Adrestia'' and Kassandra headed out to investigate. She overheard one of the villagers begging the local magistrate for help as she passed.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Help! Please! Help me, please!''\n*'''Magistrate:''' ''It's not my village, so it's not my problem. I don't know what else you want me to say.''\nAnother civilian commented on the village's plight. \n*'''Civilian:''' ''These poor people. They don't deserve this.''\nKassandra headed up the hill to the village proper, which was on fire. She found a group of [[soldier]]s preparing to execute the villagers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're here to kill. Why attack this village? They're innocent...''\nKassandra approached a [[Aiantides|civilian]] about to be executed.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Please, I have a family! I didn't do anything!''\nShe eliminated the soldier, freeing the man.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Fucking ''mal\u00e1kes''. That was close.''\nShe then killed another soldier and freed a woman.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Oh, thank the gods! They... they heard me! Thank you!''\nKassandra then freed the last man.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Thank [[Zeus]], ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. Thank you!''\n[[File:ACOD LotFB - The Horsemen Cometh - Kassandra Village Centre.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra in the middle of the village]]\nKassandra stepped towards the center of the village and observed a hanged man. A soldier attempted to sneak up on her. She then heard a voice.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Misthios, watch out!''\nBefore the soldier could run his sword through Kassandra, the man quickly drew his [[Natakas' Hunting Bow|bow]] and fired an arrow through the eye slot of the soldier's helmet, killing him instantly. The man approached Kassandra.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''More people near the [[Sparta]]n camp need help.''\n[[File:ACOD LotFB - The Horsemen Cometh - Order Elite Appears.png|thumb|250px|Persians confronting Kassandra and Natakas]]\nAs they were talking, a [[Order Elite|masked man]] approached with two guards.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Iran|Persians]]?''\n*'''Unknown:''' ''Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''You\u2014You are the Eagle Bearer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Go!''\nThe man ran away.\n*'''Unknown:''' ''The [[Pactyas (Ancients)|Huntsman]] will be pleased when we bring him your head.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're welcome to try.''\nThe man signaled his men to attack Kassandra.\n*'''Persian Soldier:''' ''You're smaller than the stories say, \"Eagle Bearer.\"''\nDespite their taunts, the Eagle Bearer easily dispatched them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's more people to help at the Spartan Camp. I should head there.''\nKassandra left the village and traveled to the nearby Spartan camp. As she travelled, she wondered about the man who saved her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who was that who saved me?''\nAs Kassandra approached the camp, she spotted the man near the bushes.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I knew you'd come. The Spartans are here slaughtering everyone. We have to stop them!''\n[[File:ACOD LotFBH The Horsemen Cometh - Spartan Camp.jpg|thumb|250px|The Spartan camp]]\nKassandra approached the camp and eliminated the Spartan soldiers, saving the civilians held captive.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' Misthios'', you saved us.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''I wouldn't be here without you.''\nKassandra talked to the man.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Eagle Bearer\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Call me Kassandra.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''My name's Natakas.''\n(If \"How do the Persians know me?\" was chosen)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They called me the Eagle Bearer. How do they know about me?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I'm not sure. But they're certainly looking for ''something.\n(If \"The Persian mentioned a 'Huntsman.'\" was chosen)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Huntsman sounds like a name I should know.''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''And if he's here, we're fucked...''\nKassandra nodded.\n[[File:ACOD The Horsemen Cometh - Natakas Thanking Kassandra.png|thumb|250px|Natakas official meeting with Kassandra]]\n*'''Natakas:''' ''I need to take care of these people. That Order Elite passed through here, killing as he went. He left tracks nearby.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll follow him.''\nNatakas walked off before stopping. He turned around.\n*'''Natakas:''' ''Thank you, Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For what?''\n*'''Natakas:''' ''For helping. When nobody else would.''\nKassandra smiled and nodded, then headed off as Natakas took his leave.",

    "Section_Description": "After letting some time pass after their poor first meeting, Kassandra decided to pay [[Persephone]] a visit.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra entered Persephone's throne room atop [[Pherephassa Point]], the highest peak of the [[Asphodel Fields]]. Persephone called to her from her throne.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I didn't get a good look at you back there.'' Now ''I see why my guards had trouble with you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well. They weren't exactly easy.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I'm sure they aren't what you mortals are used to. You must be someone special.''  \n<tabber>\n|-|I'm flattered.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you, uh, your majesty.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''A simple \"Persephone\" will do just fine in my realm. Formalities are for the boring \u2013 isn't that what they say?'' \n|-|This isn't what I expected.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're acting pretty nice for someone who just tried to kill me.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Consider that a misunderstanding. It isn't every day I see a new face in my realm, much less one as lively as yours.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So Elysium belongs to you.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''After the rude introduction I gave you, I can't blame you for not knowing \u2013 let me apologize. [[Ros]] can attest. Usually he's the one that does the biting.''\nRos barks in agreement.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''He would want you to forgive me, too. Tell me your name. Let's begin again \u2013 on the right foot, this time.'' \n<tabber>\n|-|I forgive you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No hard feelings. My name's Kassandra.''\n|-|I'll think about it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I tend to take attacks against me personally.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I understand your mistrust, but I want to be friends. This place is paradise, after all. There's no room for enemies.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This place ''is'' beautiful. I'm Kassandra.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Then I give you my official welcome, Kassandra. Let me tell you what's customary around here. This place is mine. I know every flower, every face. I alone let them in. But there's something here I ''don't'' want.''\nKassandra stepped forward to inspect the giant pit in the center of the throne room.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean me.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''No. There's a [[Orphnaeus|beast]] loose in Elysium, and it belongs to [[Hades]]. If it gets to him that his \"wife\" stole one of his immortal mounts, it'll be a disaster. But ''I'' didn't steal it. I won't go near the things\u2014they brought me down here in the first place. No, someone wants me to look bad, and I need that horse gone.''\n(\"How do you feel about Hades?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' The'' Hades? I'll take it you aren't a happy couple.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''He's tried, of course, to bond with me. But what can he expect out of a prisoner? Love? That's just stuff of legend.''\n(\"Who would frame you?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You think someone would do this to you?''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''It's highly unlikely the thing got in here on its own. I have to remember Elysium is ''my'' paradise\u2014not everyone else's.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll go find the horse.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see if I can find the horse for you. What does it look like?''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''You'll know it when you see it, trust me. Not only is the beast immortal, but he is ''terrifying.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Horses don't scare me. Has anyone seen him lately?''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I heard screams coming from the [[Asphodel Arboretum]]\u2014perhaps he's scaring civilians. Bring it to my stable boy, the [[Jockey of Artemision]]. He'll know how to send it galloping back to the nightmare it came from.''\nKassandra nodded and took her leave.\n\nKassandra traveled to the Asphodel Arboretum. [[Ikaros]] located the horse's likely hiding place in the main building.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That looks like a good place for a horse to take shelter.''\nAs she approached the arboretum, she heard a commotion.\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''Ah! Get away from that beast!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wonder what's wrong with ''them.\nKassandra found an open window on the building's south side and climbed in. She found the horse in the care of a single [[Mulios|blind old man]].\n*'''Mulios:''' ''Don't come any closer! You're all scaring my horse. He's just a gentle creature.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you ''seen'' your horse? The others ran away screaming.''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''Leave it to a blind man to see what's right in front of him. Of course I haven't ''seen'' it! I'm sorry. These are hard times.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm afraid I won't make them any easier. I have to take that horse from you.''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''You can't! First Persephone takes my sight, and then you take Orphie? Our friendship was instant! I heard the neigh of a fierce horse. I approached him, unafraid, and he licked my palm.''\n(\"Why were you blinded?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did you say Persephone blinded you?''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''She had one of her godly soldiers fry me with fire. It was punishment for telling others what I thought of this \"paradise,\" and somehow it got back to her. Said I didn't deserve to see the beauty she'd created.''\n(\"I have to get the horse out of Elysium.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's not supposed to be in Elysium.''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''Are any of us? In a realm that boasts perfection, but shows only deceit? Have pity, let him stay with me.'' \n<tabber>\n|-|You can keep the horse.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, you can keep him. But it's a risk. You could be caught.''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''A risk I'm willing to take. Oh, Orphie. When we're safe, we shall ride together in the fields!''\nKassandra returned to Persephone.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Good news, I take it? I know Hades will be missing his beast.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nLie \u2013 I took the horse to the Jockey of Artemision.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found him and took him to your stable boy like you asked.''\nPersephone leaned forward to kiss Kassandra on the cheek.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''You have no idea the trouble you've saved me. You've earned my favor.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI took care of it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Everything's take care of.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Hmm. I'll have one of my generals check up with my stable boy. I hope the creature didn't scare him too much.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not at all, rest assured.''\n}}\nKassandra left.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Better pay that stable boy a visit to cover my tracks.''\nKassandra found the Jockey of Artemision at the [[Shrine of Stallions]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You must be the Jockey of Artemision. Nice horses.''\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''I keep them clean and pretty\u2014just like Elysium! I tended horses in my old life, too.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you're just the boy I need to talk to. I have a favor to ask.''\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''What favor?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nLet's make a deal. [1000]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If Persephone or any of her people ask, I need you to tell them I brought you a big, scary horse to you.''\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''A scary horse? We don't have those here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then you'll have to pretend. There's drachmae for you if you do.''\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''You're silly. We don't need drachmae in Elysium! You're sure you're from around here?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course, I knew that. No matter what, you need to do what I say.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nDo what I say.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Listen closely. If Persephone or her generals come sniffing around here, I need you to tell them I brought you a big horse.''\n}}\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''Why do you want me to lie?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Because if you don't, I'll make sure all your horses get out of their pens and run away to [[Tartaros]]. Understand? Tell them I was here.''\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''Fine. Just leave my horses alone!''\n|-|It has to go back to Hades.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Little do ''you'' know that this is Hades' horse. It's going back to him.''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''I don't care, I would risk even Hades' punishment for Orphie. Mark my words, I won't forget this.''\nKassandra mounted Orphnaeus.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whoa, boy. Don't tell [[Phobos]], but you are one impressive beast.''\nKassandra rode the horse out of the arboretum into the open fields.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to take this horse to either Adonis, or to the stable boy. Who to choose...''\nKassandra rode the horse to the Jockey of Artemision at the Shrine of Stallions.\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''Woah, what is that? He's not like any of my horses.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's a special horse and belongs to Hades. That's who he needs to return to. Persephone told me you could get him there.''\n*'''Jockey of Artemision:''' ''It's because Persephone knows I can ride any horse anywhere. I'll take it from here!''\nKassandra returned to Persephone.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Good news, I take it? I know Hades will be missing his beast.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found him and took him to your stable boy like you asked.''\nPersephone leaned forward to kiss Kassandra on the cheek.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''You have no idea the trouble you've saved me. You've earned my favor.''\nKassandra left.\n|-|I'm bringing it to Adonis's rebellion.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The horse is going to Adonis. I think he could use it for his cause.''\n*'''Mulios:''' ''The rebellion's real? I don't like it, but I guess he would be used for good... Goodbye, my Orphie.''\nKassandra mounted Orphnaeus.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whoa, boy. Don't tell Phobos, but you are one impressive beast.''\nKassandra rode the horse out of the arboretum into the open fields.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to take this horse to either Adonis, or to the stable boy. Who to choose...''\nKassandra rode the horse to Adonis' ally in [[Minos' Faith]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought Adonis could make good use of this horse. Will you make sure it gets to him?''\n*'''Mortal Rebel:''' ''This horse? So long as it doesn't trample me, I'll take it to him on your behalf.''\nKassandra returned to Persephone.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Good news, I take it? I know Hades will be missing his beast.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nLie \u2013 I took the horse to the Jockey of Artemision.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found him and took him to your stable boy like you asked.''\nPersephone leaned forward to kiss Kassandra on the cheek.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''You have no idea the trouble you've saved me.

    "Section_Outcome": "Depending on choices Kassandra either leaves Orphnaeus with [[Mulios]], recovers the horse and brings it back to the [[Jockey of Artemision]], or gives the horse to [[Adonis]]' rebellion.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Letting Mulios keep the horse results in a reduction of -50 Persephone's Influence in the Asphodel Fields region. However, bringing the horse to Adonis' man in Minos' Faith results in a -50 Influence reduction in both Asphodel Fields and Minos' Faith, for an overall total of -100 across Elysium. The number is significant, but ultimately unnecessary given the ample opportunities for players to reduce Influence.",

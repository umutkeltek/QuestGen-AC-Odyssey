    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra and Phoibe traveled towards the [[Ixion Wheel]] in the hopes of finding the girl's parents.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''The last I heard about my parents, they were hiding near the Ixion Wheel.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hiding? From what?''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''The [[underworld]] is scary. Maybe they're not fighters like us? I could teach them what you taught me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure you could.''\nAs they approached a village near the Ixion Wheel, they heard a woman cry out for help.\n*'''Mortal Woman:''' ''Help us!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phoibe, stay back!''\nKassandra entered the village and killed the [[Cyclops of Kephallonia|one eyed man]]'s guards. She and Phoibe entered a ruined house and spoke to the woman, the sole survivor of the thugs' raid.\n*'''Survivor:''' ''Please! I already told you\u2014go tell the Cyclops the girl isn't here, and neither is her family. Now get back!''\nShe brandished her knife at Kassandra, albeit unable to stand.\n<tabber>\n|-|I won't hurt you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Relax. We're not going to hurt you, but we need to know what happened here.''\n|-|Don't threaten me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No one threatens me. Put down the blade and start talking.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Kassandra! Sorry. What she means to say is we're not goingt to hurt you. We just need to know what happened here.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Survivor:''' ''Those thugs followed the Cyclops of Kephallonia to their graves, and now they follow him in the underworld. He sent them through here looking for a girl.''\nKassandra and Phoibe exchanged glances.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''The man with one eye...''\n*'''Survivor:''' ''Have you ever met a girl named Phoibe?''\nKassandra and Phoibe looked at each other once more, before deciding how much information to give the woman.\n<tabber>\n|-|This is Phoibe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is Phoibe.''\n*'''Survivor:''' ''So you are. My dear, I loved your parents as I loved my own. They hid here with me and told tales about the great warrior Phoibe who sailed to [[Elysium]].''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''They called her me warrior?''\n*'''Survivor:''' ''When [[Cerberos]] died, they snuck off to find you themselves... But the Cyclops is looking for you, too.''\n|-|I've never heard of her.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We don't know a Phoibe... Why were they looking for the girl?''\n*'''Survivor:''' ''I'm not sure. I was a friend to her parents. They used to hide here. They told tales of their daughter, a great warrior who sailed to [[Elysium]].''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''They called her a warrior?''\n*'''Survivor:''' ''When [[Cerberos]] died, they snuck off to the golden fields to find her, but now the Cyclops is looking for them all.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''Excuse us, please.''\nKassandra and Phoibe stepped outside.\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I remember now. The man with one eye is the Cyclops. He forced me to drink the water.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He must know we stole your [[Chara|eagle]] back and came to retaliate.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''What do we do?''\n<tabber>\n|-|We find the Cyclops.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The gates to Elysium are open, but you know the Cyclops. He won't stop until he gets what he wants. We have to deal with him.''\n|-|We find your parents.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The gates to Elysium are open. That's how your parents got through. I know the way.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''What about her? She's a friend of my parents. I want to help her.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She seems like she can fend for herself.''\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''The [[Keres]] are magic, and they heal people who get hurt in battle. They live close by. I could...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Phoibe...''\n<tabber>\n|-|(If said \"We find the Cyclops.\")=\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I can do this! I'll be quick, then we can fight the Cyclops.''\n|-|(If said \"We find your parents.\")=\n*'''Phoibe:''' ''I can do this! I'll be quick, then we'll go to Elysium and find my parents.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. But don't take too long, or I'm coming after you.''\nPhoibe nodded and took off with a start. Kassandra stayed to keep the woman company. However, a great deal of time had passed, and Phoibe had not returned. Kassandra finally decided to go after her.",

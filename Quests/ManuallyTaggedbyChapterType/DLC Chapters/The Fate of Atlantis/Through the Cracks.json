There, she found it to be heavily guarded.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's a lot of [[guards]] for a quarry. I wonder why.''\nKassandra entered the quarry, sneaking into the foreman's quarters. She confronted the [[Isu Foreman]] placed in charge of the area.\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''Welll, isn't this an honor? How'd you get past my guards?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm looking for Damades.''\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''And why would the great ''[[Dikastes]]'' be looking for missing [[human]]s?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I never said he was missing.''\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''Very clever, [[hybrid]]. When my humans transport [[adamant]] to the experimentation chamber, they don't always return.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me where the chamber is.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A little boy is worried about is Father.  Just tell me where this experimention chamber is.''\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''Your compassion for humans is unproductive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your hatred for humans is self-destructive.''\n|-|Threaten \u2013 Point me to the chamber, or else.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me where this chamber is or I'll make you eat your precious adamant.''\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''Primitive. Violence is all your kind understands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''Fine. It's in the [[Garden of Kymopoleia]]. But you're wasting your time. The doors are locked.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then I'll just have to find the key.''\n*'''Isu Foreman:''' ''You can try, hybrid.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Kill \u2013 Not before killing you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know, treating humans like vermin will get you killed one day. That day is today.''\nKassandra eliminated the foreman.\n|-|Leave \u2013 I'll be going now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know, treating humans like vermin will get you killed one day.  Consider yourself lucky I'm not making that day today.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra exited the foreman's quarters.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't like the sounds of this experimentation chamber. And what do the Isu need with all this adamant?''",

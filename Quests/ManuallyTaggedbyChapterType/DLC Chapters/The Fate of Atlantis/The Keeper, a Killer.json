    "Section_Trivia": "*If Hermes is fought by refusing to kill the human targets, the \"fought to a draw\" outcome is determined when he deals significant damage to the player. However, if they have very low Health (possible, for example, with the [[Falx of Olympos]] or a weapon that uses its [[Engraving]] equipped, which hard-caps Health to 25%), or Hermes deals enough damage in a single combo (highly possible with difficulty-scaling), he will move immediately into the kill animation for sword-wielding soldiers, meaning the player will be killed as such and de-synchronize.\n*This quest is a pre-requisite for the memory \"[[A Life for a Life]]\", which is in turn a pre-requisite for \"[[The Beacons Are Lit]]\".",

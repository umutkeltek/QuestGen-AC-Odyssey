If only you were dead, you could stay forever.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Unfortunately... Not my plan.''\n*'''Charon:''' ''Such is life. And death. on to the next lost souls. A family devastated by wars wanders without refuge.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I know how that feels.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know how it feels to lose a home.''\n|-|That's the cost of war.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Plenty of people lose everything in war.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Charon:''' ''Yes, you all have sad stories to tell. At least most who come here are dead now.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think I would still be sad if I was dead.''\n*'''Charon:''' ''The suffering you fleshlings inflict on each other never ceases to astound me. And that's why we are helping all the lost we can.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right, they deserve to have somewhere safe to stay.''\n[[File:ACOD FoA ToH Home is Where You Make It 02.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra meets the family]]\nKassandra travelled to the [[Village of the Condemned]], where the lost family were residing in.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like someone is hidding over there.''\nShe approached the family: a couple and a child.\n*'''Mortal Woman:''' ''Please, don't hurt us. Leave us alone.''\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''Stay back! I know how to fight.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not here to hurt you.''\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''Then what do you want?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've come to take you away from this place. Take you somewhere safe.''\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''Why would you want to help us?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I was asked to help you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was asked to find you and take you to safety.''\n*'''Mortal Woman:''' ''We have no friends here, only each other.  But the hounds are drawing close, so what choice do we have?''\n|-|We need to leave now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no time, the hounds of Hades are coming, and when they find you...''\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''I can't let my family suffer here anymore. All right, what's your plan?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There has to be somewhere nearby where you'd be safe.''\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''There's a cave not too far from here that could provide some shelter. It didn't look very exciting, but it's better than here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anywhere else?''\n*'''Mortal Woman:''' ''There was also an abandoned camp. It would be ideal if not for all the strange creatures in the area... It could be dangerous.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll take you to the cave.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should go to the cave. Stay close.''\nKassandra escorted the family to the outskirts. Riding on horses, they followed the road on their way to the cave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I hear something. We need to hurry. We're too exposed out here.''\nAlong the way, they encountered numerous hounds of Hades.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The hounds! Stay behind me.''\nKassandra eliminated the hounds. She and the family continued their way and reach the cave. There, they were ambushed by the [[Erinyes]].\n*'''Mortal Child:''' ''Help! The Erinyes are coming!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The sisters of vengeance are... real?''\nAfter Kassandra took care of the attackers, the family was able to reside in their new home.\nKassandra spoke to the man again.\n*'''Mortal Man:''' ''We'll be safe here. Thank you for helping us.''\n|-|I'll take you to the camp.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should go to the camp. Stay close.''\nKassandra escorted the family to the outskirts. Riding on horses, they followed the road on their way to the camp.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I hear something. We need to hurry. We're too exposed out here.''\nAlong the way, they encountered numerous hounds of Hades.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The hounds! Stay behind me.''\nKassandra eliminated the hounds. She and the family continued their way and reach the camp site, where she found numerous [[soldier]]s, After killing them and their captain, the family was thus able to reside there.\nKassandra spoke to the woman again.\n*'''Mortal Woman:''' ''This camp will serve us well.

    "General_Description": "'''Crowd Pleaser''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Gadiros]], son of [[Poseidon]] to help him with problems regarding [[human]] subjects.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled to an arena near the [[Doma of Elasippos]], where she found Gadiros with the help of [[Ikaros]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''An arena seems like a strange playce for an Archon.''\nShe entered the arena to meet with the slightly drunk Gadiros.\n*'''Gadiros:''' [[Dikastes]]''! Thank the stars! I was beginning to lose all hope.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Atlas]] said you needed help.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''You don't understand the responsibility on my shoulders. It's my job to concoct entertainment for the masses. But I fear the crowd have grown bored of my grand spectacles.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've seen some good plays... and some bad ones.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''We need more than a simple play. If the audience leave my shows bored and restless, who knows what they'll start plotting.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You think they'll become violent.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''My purpose is to keep them occupied so they ''can't'' be violent.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You need to be more creative.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If your shows have become boring, you just need to get more creative.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''The humans are primitive, their tastes basic. They like life's simpler joys. Blood. Tragedy. Romance. That sort of thing.''\n|-|Distractions don't solve problems.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Trying to distract people from their problems will only work for so long.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''I misspoke. I've seen what these humans are capable of, given the chance. I'm not distracting them. Merely... keeping them happy.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So give the people what they want.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''What they want... Yes. Yes, I can hear the cheers now! \"The legendary ''Dikastes'', Kassandra, takes on [[Atlantis]]'s finest warriors!\" You must take part in my next event!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like a [[pankration]]. I can definitely help with that.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Not exactly! But I ''was'' inspired by your efforts in [[Elis]]. I know you'll do an exemplary job entertaining the crowds as you did then. If we pull this off, we'll be the talk of the city!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's worth a try.''\nAs Gadiros said, Kassandra took part in his spectacle in the arena, where she had to fight a group of Atlantean Guards, while Gadiros commentated.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Welcome one, welcome all to yet another miraculous show here in our beloved city. Tonight, we have a very special guest. The ''Dikastes'' of Atlantis is here to entertain you.<br>Our hero's ''first'' challenge comes from the vaults of Atlantis itself. Can our mighty ''Dikastes'' overcome the power of the Atlantean Guard? Let's find out!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right Kassandra, be entertaining. That's what he said.''\nKassandra defeated the guards, while trying to do it in the most entertaining way she could by eliminating two guards with arrows to please the crowd\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''That was thrilling. What a display.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is definitely not a ''[[pankration]]''.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Our valiant hero's next challenge fast approaches. A Champion bested by none in the city. No mercy, no guilt. Will this be to much for even the ''Dikastes'' to overcome?''\nKassandra faced the Arena Champion whom after a tough fight she was able to defeat and bring to his knees.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''The Champion has been bested. Our mighty ''Dikastes'' is victorious and the crowd have spoken. But will she show mercy or will she spill the blood we want?''\n*'''Arena Champion:''' ''If you don't appease the crowd, I fear what Gadiros will do. It was an honor to fight you,'' Dikastes.\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll show mercy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You don't deserve to die just for losing.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Our merciful ''Dikastes'' has passed judgment, but do not dismay. Our Champion lives to fight another day, for you, the audience.''\n|-|Kill - I have to kill you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You fought honorably''\nKassandra drew her weapon and put an end to the Champion's life.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''A fitting end to a glorious life spent in service to you, the audience. Now, onto the grand finale.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''And here we are, the end of today's event. Next to face our ''Dikastes's'' judgment, the very scum that taints our city.''\nKassandra turned around to find a group of unarmed civilians brought to her in the arena.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By the gods... What is this?''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''For the good of Atlantis, today bare witness to the guilty and condemned given one final chance at redemption. They will be honored to die at the hands of our guest.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Kill- [Execute]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If they're criminals, then this has to be done.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Let the slaughter commence!''\nKassandra drew her weapons an slew every last one of the defenseless humans.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''The guilty and condemned have been judged! Hail our wise ''Dikastes''!''\nAfter the show was over a euphoric Gadiros met with Kassandra.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''What a show! What a show!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people seemed entertained.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''And why wouldn't they be? You put on a performance for the ages.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe games should continue.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If this kind of entertainment keeps the peace, then maybe it has value.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''I know the games seem barbaric, but sometimes we must feed the primitive beast within to keep it dormant. Now I must begin preparing for my next great event. Thank you for your help,'' Dikastes.\nGadiros left.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThe games must stop.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This won't help the relations between your people. The humans will see what's going on eventually.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''I fear that if we stop, things will get worse, but you see things differently than all of us here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe their tastes aren't so \"primitive\". Maybe they'll surprise you.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''I whis i had your optimism, but only time will tell. Perhaps I'll even recruit a few humans to help me.''\nGadiros left.\n}}\n|-|Leave - [Refuse]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough! I'm not doing this.''\nA bit stunned by Kassandras refusal to kill the humans Gadiros tried to appease the crowd.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Fear not, friends. We will make sure justice is delivered.''\nAfter the show was over an angered Gadiros met with Kassandra.\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Well that was an unmitigated disaster.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You said fight, so i fought.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''The ''problem'' is that I didn't say fight. I said be as entertaining as possible.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe games should contine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If this kind of entertainment keeps the peace, then maybe it has value.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThe games must stop.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This won't help the relations between your people. The humans will see what's going on eventually.''\n}}\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''The games have failed. The humans are restless, and it's only a matter of time before they make their own entertainment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You just need to keep surprising them. Think like a human, not an [[Isu]].''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''That's what I tried to do, but you showed the criminals mercy and the crowd reacted as I expected.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing people who can't defend themselves isn't entertainment. It's slaughter.''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''Their sacrifice helps us keep the peace and maintain order. Or, it would have if you'd played along.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you saying, Gadiros?''\n*'''Gadiros:''' ''That my grand experiment has failed. There's nothing left to be done but start again and try for better results. The arena must be cleared''\nGadiros left and ordered his men to slaughter the spectators in the arena.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is madness.''\n</tabber>",

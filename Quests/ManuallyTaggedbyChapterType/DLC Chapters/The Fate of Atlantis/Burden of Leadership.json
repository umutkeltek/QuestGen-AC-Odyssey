    "General_Description": "'''Burden of Leadership''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "As part of her first job to maintain order as the ''dikastes'', Kassandra met with [[Atlas (Isu)|Atlas]], one of the sons of [[Poseidon]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra entered the [[Doma of Atlas]] and stood before him on his throne. The messenger she met earlier bowed to her. \n*'''Atlas:''' ''Ah, you\u2019ve arrived. I\u2019m honored the ''Dikastes'' would accept my humble request.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're Atlas, I take it.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''In the flesh. I thank you for coming to see me. I'm sure you're very busy. The burden my [[Poseidon|father]] gave you is not a light one.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm happy to help.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your messenger told me it was urgent.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Gravely urgent, indeed.''\n|-|Dikastes is a big job.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I seem to have a lot to do around here thanks to Poseidon, but if I can help, I will.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''A noble pursuit. As my messenger stressed, the situation is dire. The ''Dikastes'' is just who I need.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, here I am.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''It's my brothers, the Archons. They have issues with the human populations under their control. Tensions between [[Isu]] and humans are mounting. Without order, the problems will grow severe.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll try and use my position to help them where I can.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Find [[Gadiros]], [[Ampheres]], and [[Azaes]]. Through your shining example, I hope they learn the valuable lessons in discipline they so desperately need.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And if I help them, you're hoping it'll maintain the peace between Isu and humans.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''That's the plan. Poseidon should have known they weren't ready for the responsibility an Archon bears, but that's his failing.''\n(Asked \"Who is Gadiros?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me about Gadiros.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''You'll find him near the Arena hard at work planning his next exhilarating spectacle, I'm sure.''\n(Asked \"Who is Ampheres?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What should I know about Ampheres?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''He's probably off terrorizing people near the [[Fortified Doma of Autochthonos]]. Make sure you don't sneak up on him, he's quite jumpy.''\n(Asked \"Who is Azaes?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What about Azaes? Who is he?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''You'll find dear Azaes wherever there is humanitarian work to be done. I heard there were some issues near the [[Doma of Ampheres]].''\n(Asked \"What do the Archons do?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We have Archons where I'm from. Do they fulfill the same duties?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''They are charged with overseeing and ruling the humans of Atlantis, ensuring all live comfortably and peacefully. A job at which I fear they're failing.''\n(Asked \"Why is there tension in Atlantis?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There always seems to be unrest between the two races. The [[underworld]] and [[Elysium]] were no different.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Time passes and tensions keep building. I expected my father to handle it, but Atlantis grows steadily worse, and no one wants to see what could happen if precautions are not taken.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I have what I need.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find the Archons and make sure their problems are taken care of.''\nAs she turned to leave, the messenger cleared his throat to get her attention before grinning sheepishly and casting a sidelong glance at the adjacent room.\nKassandra left to solve the issues facing Gadiros, Ampheres, and Azaes, who had to deal with [[Crowd Pleaser|boredom]], [[Rebel Scum|rebellion]], and [[The Atlantean Patient|plague]], respectively.\nAfter helping the first Archon, Kassandra mused to herself.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's one Archon helped. I hope they're all not this intense.''\nAfter helping the second Archon, Kassandra spoke to herself again.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just one more Archon to go. Maybe I should just do their jobs, too?''\nWith the Archons' issues resolved, Kassandra returned to Atlas to find his brothers before him in chains on their knees.\n*'''Atlas:''' Dikastes'', welcome back. I'm glad you could be here to witness this momentous occasion.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why are the Archons in chains?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I invited my dear siblings here for one final lesson in leadership.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It looks like an execution to me.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Every experience in life should be a lesson. Including death. You've been to the underworld, so I know you understand what these fools do not.''\n<tabber>\n|-|The Archons' problems are fixed.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You asked me to help the Archons. I did. Their problems are solved.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Their problems only existed because they couldn't perform the duties their roles demanded.''\n|-|You're going to pay, Atlas.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm going to make you pay for this.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Calm down, Kassandra. I didn't deceive you as much as you think. My brothers' problems were real and ''did'' need solving.''\n|-|I'm the teacher here, not you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Careful, Atlas. ''I'' am the ''Dikastes''. If anyone is passing judgment here, it's me.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Don't presume to think you can tell me what to do. The authority of your position doesn't extend to my palace.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're going to murder your brothers? For what?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''For order... For peace... For Atlantis!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For Atlas, you mean.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I am the rightful heir to Atlantis. I should be the ''Dikastes!'' I cannot defy Poseidon's will, but these fools don't deserve their power. I'll be a better Archon in their stead.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Poseidon won't approve.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Once Poseidon finds out what you've done, he won't let you get away with it.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nProblems solved compassionately=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''That is our way\u2014the way of progress. You are not one of us. I've seen your compassion to those who dwell in this city. Perhaps our ways are not as perfect as Poseidon thinks they are.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Parents do what they think is best, but it doesn't mean they're always right. We have to look after each other no matter what we're told.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Wise, ''Dikastes''. I respect your decision... for the moment.''\nAtlas stepped forward and held his hand over his brothers, teleporting them out of the doma. Kassandra smiled.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nProblems solved ruthlessly=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Our father always encouraged us to compete with each other. If he were here, he'd execute them himself, just as you executed those poor humans in the Arena.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They were criminals!''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''And the \"resistance\"? Face it, ''Dikastes'', if the roles were reversed, you'd pass the same judgment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You might need someone new to take lessons from, Atlas.''\nAtlas fired beams of light from his hand through the heads of Gadiros and Ampheres, which flung their bodies back in Kassandra's direction. He held his hand over Azaes, who had resigned himself to his fate. Atlas killed him in the same way.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I am my own teacher.''\n}}\n|-|They're more useful to you alive.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing your brothers is a waste. Teach them to learn from their mistakes, and they'll do whatever you say. They can't do that if they're dead.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nProblems solved compassionately=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I watched you help my brothers. You always found solutions that tried to preserve life. Some of my kind view humans as a resource to be sacrificed. If we want them to progress, we must be an example.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We all look up to someone. I think they look up to you.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Wise, ''Dikastes''. I respect your decision... for the moment.''\nAtlas stepped forward and held his hand over his brothers, teleporting them out of the doma. Kassandra smiled.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nProblems solved ruthlessly=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Their ultimate failure was their lack of decisiveness. When ''you'' needed to act, you did without hesitation. But for what? To put on a show in the Arena?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They were criminals!''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''And the \"resistance\"? Face it, ''Dikastes'', if the roles were reversed, you'd pass the same judgment.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You might need someone new to take lessons from, Atlas.''\nAtlas fired beams of light from his hand through the heads of Gadiros and Ampheres, which flung their bodies back in Kassandra's direction. He held his hand over Azaes, who had resigned himself to his fate. Atlas killed him in the same way.\n*'''Atlas:''' ''I am my own teacher.''\n}}\n|-|(Let timer expire)=\n*'''Atlas:''' ''You tried, my brothers, but regrettably your services are no longer required.''\nAtlas fired beams of light from his hand through the heads of his three brothers, which flung their bodies back in Kassandra's direction. Kassandra was mortified.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Atlas, you're insane!''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''They weren't just a threat to me, Dikastes. In time, they'd have threatened your authority, too. You should be thanking me.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So what now?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''If you're going to one day rule this city, Kassandra, you're going to have to learn a very important lesson.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's what I get for helping you? A lecture?''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''Just some words of advice. Nothing in Atlantis is what it seems at face value. This city is old, and those that call it home are even older. You have helped me, ''Dikastes'', and for that you have my thanks.''\nHe handed her half of a disk-shaped keystone, similar to the ones she had seen before in the Greek world.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This isn't over, Atlas.''\n*'''Atlas:''' ''On the contrary. I'm done here.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra met with [[Atlas (Isu)|Atlas]] at his doma in the [[Royal Mountain of Poseidon]] and then proceeded to help out three archons and other sons of Poseidon, [[Gadiros]], [[Ampheres]], and [[Azaes]].",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "The choice in \"[[The Atlantean Patient]]\" of whether or not to continue using the prototype [[Shrouds of Eden|Shroud]] appears to have no impact on the outcome of this quest. A single merciful choice in either \"[[Crowd Pleaser]]\" or \"[[Rebel Scum]]\" will enable the player to save Atlas' brothers, whereas choosing both ruthless options in those quests will make their executions unavoidable. Not choosing either dialogue option and allowing the timer to expire will result in Atlas executing his brothers, regardless of previous choices.",

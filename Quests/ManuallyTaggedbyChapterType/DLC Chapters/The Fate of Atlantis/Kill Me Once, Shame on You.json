    "Section_Dialogue": "Upon Kassandra's return, she finds Bracidas pacing in front of the Arena. She gives him back his battle-worn shield.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your shield, General.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I'll never forget the day this was first handed to me. I was a boy, it was as tall as I was. My commander told me, \"To hold this is to hold up Sparta. Drop it, and Sparta falls.\"''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Tell me what Elysium is like.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It isn't what you think.''\n\nKassandra felt a chill in the air.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's... Do you feel cold?''\n\nHades had crept up on the two Spartans with little notice.\n\n*'''Hades:''' ''Elysium is boring.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not since I showed up.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Ah yes. You do have a knack for livening things up wherever you go.''\n\nHades looks over to Brasidas.\n\n*'''Hades:''' ''Still dreaming of paradise I see. Well, no one wants you to get what you deserve more than me.''\n\nHades turns away from Kassandra and Brasidas and continues to speak as he looks toward the arena.\n\n*'''Hades:''' ''I'm glad you two have found each other. We could all use a little help from time to time. Well, you've got your shield. Are you ready to face your enemy?''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I am.''\n\nWith those words, Kassandra and Brasidas made their way into the arena. Hades had left on display two corpses, exact replicas of Brasidas' manner of death at the [[Battle of Amphipolis|Battle]] of [[Amphipolis]], impaled with a [[spear]] impaled through their jaw and skull.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't look, Brasidas. Hades is trying to get to you.''\n\nThe Spartan duo approached the figure waiting for them at the center of the arena. His back was turned towards Brasidas as he spoke, with an echoed voice:\n\n*'''Deimos:''' ''It's been a long time, Brasidas. Come, face your undoing.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I am not afraid of you, Deimos.''\n\nThe figure turned towards Brasidas and Kassandra. Brasidas was shocked at what he saw. It was his mirror image wearing Deimos' armor.\n\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''What is this?''\n*'''Bane of Brasidas:''' ''An even greater enemy defeated you long before Deimos ended your life. Deimos was blessed by the fury of the gods, and even after he cut you down once, you still didn't learn.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''It wasn't hubris \u2013 I fought for honor.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You fought with hubris.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Listen, Brasidas. It was hubris. Don't make this mistake a third time.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''As Spartans... I should have known. We live together, train together...''\n\n|-|You fought with honor.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You made Sparta proud that day, Brasidas. You honored your father's oath.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''Perhaps I didn't. A Spartan should trust the warrior at their side.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This time we fight together.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''It would be my honor.''\n\nKassandra and Brasidas defeated the Bane of Brasidas inside the arena.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was good fighting together again.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I guess it's time to say goodbye.''\n\nKassandra and Brasidas left the arena. As they left and crossed the small bridge, Kassandra gasped as she nearly collided with another impaled corpse that looked like Brasidas. Hades was up to no good again, congratulating them on their victory.\n\n*'''Hades:''' ''Very good. The spears were my brother's idea. Poseidon can be cruel sometimes.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''I did as you asked. you promised me Elysium.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Hmm, not quite.''\n*'''Brasidas:''' ''But you said - ''\n*'''Hades:''' ''I said that to walk Elysium in death, the son of Sparta must confront that which defeated him in life. And you have not yet done so.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''I know, I know, It's all very hard to wrap your little mortal minds around. Which is why I'm going to help you.''\n\nKassandra confronted Hades over this.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why these games? Why not just let him go?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Because eternity is long. Letting you go wouldn't be much fun, now would it?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Find the Forest of Oizys. The dead will point the way.''\n\n(Asked \"What's the Forest of Oizys?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Forest of Oizys, sounds inviting.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''It's where I keep the miserable humans who ended their mortal suffering by their own hand.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''If there's one thing I hate, it's uninvited guests.''\n(Asked \"What are we looking for?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The dead will point the way to what?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise. You'll just have to trust me.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll do this on one condition.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come Brasidas, the sooner we get this done, the sooner you can be free of this place.''",

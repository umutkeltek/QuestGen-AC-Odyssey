    "Section_Dialogue": "While near the [[Doma of Atlas|Doma]] of [[Atlas (Isu)|Atlas]], Kassandra came across the scene of a deceased [[Soldier|guard]]. She approached the body and recovered a note.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's this? A message.''\n:'''Protect Yourselves'''<br />''The armor that's come into your possession represents protection not meant for us. It was forged for the ''[[Dikastes]]'', but who's to say they deserve all the power in [[Atlantis]]? In this realm of [[Isu]] vs [[human]], a just ''Dikastes'' will let us, the [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] [[Atlantean Polemarch|Polemarch]]s, keep it for ourselves. Until we are found out, the pieces are spread amongst you in the [[Fortified Doma of Mestor|Doma of Mestor]], [[Doma of Elasippos|Elasippos]], [[Fortified Doma of Mneseas|Mneseas]], [[Doma of Azaes|Azaes]], and [[Fortified Doma of Autochthonos|Autochthonos]]. Keep them safe.<br /><br />\u2013 B.''\n\nKassandra first travelled to the Fortified Doma of [[Mestor (Isu)|Mestor]], finding the Atlantean [[Polemarch]] [[Helmetos]]. After eliminating him, she recovered the [[Dikastes' Helmet|helmet]] piece from his body.\n\nKassandra then travelled to the Doma of [[Elasippos]], eliminating the Atlantean Polemarch [[Chestor]]. After doing so, she recovered a [[Dikastes' Breastplate|breastplate]] from his body.\n\nKassandra then travelled to the Doma of [[Azaes]], where the Atlantean Polemarch [[Legoras]] was at. After eliminating him, she recovered a [[Dikastes' Greaves|pair]] of [[greaves]] from his body. \n\nKassandra next travelled to the Fortified Doma of [[Mneseas]], finding the Atlantean Polemarch [[Bracerdas]]. After eliminating him, she recovered a [[Dikastes' Bracers|pair]] of [[bracer]]s from his body.\n\nFinally, Kassandra travelled to the Fortified Doma of [[Autochthonos]] to hunt down her final target, [[Skirtis]]. By eliminating him, she recovered the final piece of the armor, the [[Dikastes' Belt|belt]].",

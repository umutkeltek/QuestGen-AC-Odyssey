    "General_Description": "'''Rebel Scum''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Ampheres]], son of [[Poseidon]] to help him stop the [[human]]s from rioting.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled to the southeast of the [[Fortified Doma of Autochthonos]], where she found Amphores with the help of [[Ikaros]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is it.''\nShe came closer and noticed a number of guards surrounding Ampheres.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That must be Ampheres. Why so many guards?''\nWhen Kassandra approached two of the guards stepped in her way.\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Let her Pass.''\nKassandra came just in time to witness Amphores cut the throat of a captured human.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ampheres, if this is how you treat humans, I can see why you need so many guards.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''These aren't humans. They are animals. And animals should be in cages.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're the only animal here.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Dead bodies of civilians outside. A tortured corpse at your feet. The only animal I see around here is you.''\n|-|You must have your reasons.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure everything you do isn't without reason, but if you didn't call them animals, you might get a better reaction.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''A human did this to me while I slept. When they came to kill me, I survived, but the slaughtered my daughter like an animal. Humans don't act with logic or reason.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good or bad, they are driven by a will to survive.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''A trait we implanted to ensure efficiency. But, that will become a kindled flame of insurrection. You led a rebellion yourself in [[Elysium]], so I know you understand. If we don't act, the city will burn and many more lives will be lost.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't see an army marching on Poseidon.''\nBehind Ampheres one of his guards struggled to drag out the corpse of the human Amphers killed before.\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''This one said they plan to launch an attack. Someone needs to destroy the resistance before that happens.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's not a small request. Despite what you think, all humans aren't a threat.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''It is the only path I see. But you are the ''Dikastes''. Only you can choose the correct course of action.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll kill the leaders.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If we find an kill the leaders - the ones spreading the message - the rest will lose interest.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''An interesting theory. Perhaps you're right. If the leaders are removed, the rest may see the error of their opposition.''\n|-|No killing. I'll destroy their supplies.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing people will just make the fire spread faster. If we destroy their supplies and their weapons, they can't oppose the [[Isu]].''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''I admire your optimism, but i fear it will not be enough. However, it's your decision to make.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just leave it to me. I'll send a message they won't forget.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Very well. You'll find the traitorous humans at an abandoned farmstead. Return to me when the situation is resolved''\nKassandra made her way to the nearby farmstead, to take care of the resistance problem.\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra killed the leaders=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With the leaders dead, the resistance is over.''\n|-|If Kassandra destroyed the supplies=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It'll be hard to form a resistance if they have no supplies.''\n</tabber>\nShe returned to Ampheres.\n*'''Ampheres:''' Dikastes'', I'm glad to see you return safely. I almost considered sending a regiment of my guard after you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That would have been overkill.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''You can never be too careful when dealing with violent humans. Come, tell me, has the resistance been quashed?''\n<tabber>\n|-|If the leaders were killed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I killed the leaders. With them gone their movement is dead.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''A sound strategy, but i fear the problem exists at the heart of humanity itself. Another leader will rise eventually.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe Isu have nothing to fear.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you don't trust them, but the humans will never challenge the Isu directly. You are like gods to them. You must see that.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Is is an illusion we have tried to nurture already, but it won't last. However, for now, you've done what was needed.''\nAmpheres left.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWe will remove all threats.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And when a new leader rises, we will remove them as well. It's the best way to prevent you fears from happening.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Your strategy is logical, but to be ever vigilant is a daunting prospect. Perhaps it's weight someone must always carry. For now, that someone is you.''\nAmpheres left.\n}}\n|-|If the supplies were destroyed=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I destroyed their supplies and equipment.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''You believe you've saved lives by being merciful, but the truth is that more will die in the end.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nThe humans are not a threat.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I promise you - they're no threat.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''You underestimat them. Yes, you've taken their means of striking now, but they will regroup and find more weapons. All you have done is delay the inevitable.''\nAmpheres left.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThis was my choice to make.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am ''Dikastes''. I chose the best course of action as I saw it.''\n*'''Ampheres:''' ''Forgive my bluntness, I just believe your judgment could have been impaired by the fact you're part-human.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Apology accepted.''\nAmpheres left.\n}}\n</tabber>",

    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "If players choose to destroy the supplies instead of killing the leaders, when the player still kills the enemies at the abandoned farmstead, the memory acts like Kassandra chose to kill the leaders regardless of what decision was made. To complete burning the supplies, try avoiding killing the enemies.\n\nThe name of this memory is a reference to the curse often used by Imperial soldiers in ''{{Wiki|Star Wars}}''.",

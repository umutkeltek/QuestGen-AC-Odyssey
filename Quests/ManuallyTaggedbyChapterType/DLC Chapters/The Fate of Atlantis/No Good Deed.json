    "General_Description": "'''No Good Deed''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "After the symposium took an unexpected turn, [[Kassandra]] returned to [[Hekate]] seeking answers.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra reached Hekate's hovel at the [[Sunken Temple of Pheraia]]. Hekate was not there, but she found [[Persephone]] sitting in Hekate's throne.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No sign of Hekate. But what's Persephone doing here?''\nKassandra approached her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Persephone. I was looking for Hekate.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I can't imagine what you'd need her for, but... never mind. Do you know what the hardest part is about my life here?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''It's not knowing who to trust. Hekate has been my dearest friend ever since my mother, [[Demeter]], sent her to me. But after that nonsense with [[Lethe]]'s water, I've been keeping a closer eye on her. Hekate always tells me where she's going, but not this time. My spies tell me she's about to resurface for a secret meeting at [[Iphigenia's Compound]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like the meeting's not so secret anymore.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''That's where you come in. Spy on her and report back to me. I'm trusting you with this. Please, don't let me down.''\nKassandra took her leave and traveled to Iphigenia's Compound.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like this is my chance to find out what Hekate's up to, too.''\nAt the compound, [[Ikaros]] identified the building where Hekate held her meeting.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There she is!''\nKassandra infiltrated the compound and made her way to the building's entrance. Inside, she knelt beside a large planter to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]] on Hekate and her associate, who turned out to be [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]].\n*'''Hekate:''' ''I was wondering when you'd arrive, locksmith.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''You know I prefer Key Maker.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Your mastery of language is overwhelming as always. How you stay so humble is beyond me.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''You know why I'm here, Hekate. We need to talk about your newfound friend, the Keeper.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Don't worry, I didn't tell Kassandra about the key to the [[underworld]] you cleverly disguised as [[Ros]]' collar. Why would I want her running straight to Persephone's palace?''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''It's not about that. I know you've been spending a lot of time together. And undermining Persephone in the process.''\n<tabber>\n|-|[Wait]=\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Kassandra has been undermining Persephone, not me. At least, that's what Persephone will see when I'm through.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''I'm all too familiar with your ability to whisper in Persephone's ear, but whatever tale you spin for her isn't the truth, is it? You've been trying to push Persephone out of power.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\n[Wait]=\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Hermes, you know her quest for control is corrupting her. You must see that Persephone has changed.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''The only one who wants control is you. Why can't you support her? It's true. You ''are'' jealous of her.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Doing everything Persephone tells you isn't helping her, Hermes. Let alone getting you what you so desperately desire.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Could either of us really help her after what she's gone through? But I'm no traitor.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\n[Wait]=\n*'''Hekate:''' ''You know I love Persephone like a sister, Hermes. If I could free her from Elysium, I would. But freeing her from corruption is the best I can do.''\nA [[Vanguard (simulation)|vanguard]] walked in behind Kassandra.\n*'''Guard:''' ''Hey! You're not supposed to be here.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Keeper!''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Hermes, we have to go.''\nHekate and Hermes fled while the guard tossed Kassandra out of the room.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n[Interrupt]=\nKassandra came out of hiding and confronted the two.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough! I want answers.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Keeper!''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Not many humans could catch me off guard. But stealth doesn't matter now. Only speed.''\nHekate and Hermes fled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''! If she gets to Persephone first, who knows what she'll trell her?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n[Leave]=\nKassandra had heard enough and decided to leave before she was spotted.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get to Persephone first no matter what.''\n}}\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n[Interrupt]=\nKassandra came out of hiding and confronted the two.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough! I want answers.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Keeper!''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Not many humans could catch me off guard. But stealth doesn't matter now. Only speed.''\nHekate and Hermes fled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''! If she gets to Persephone first, who knows what she'll trell her?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n[Leave]=\nKassandra had heard enough and decided to leave before she was spotted.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get to Persephone first no matter what.''\n}}\n|-|[Interrupt]=\nKassandra came out of hiding and confronted the two.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Enough! I want answers.''\n*'''Hermes:''' ''Keeper!''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Not many humans could catch me off guard. But stealth doesn't matter now. Only speed.''\nHekate and Hermes fled.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka''! If she gets to Persephone first, who knows what she'll trell her?''\n|-|[Leave]=\nKassandra had heard enough and decided to leave before she was spotted.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to get to Persephone first no matter what.''\n</tabber>\nWith her business in Iphigenia's Compound dealt with, Kassandra hurried back to [[Pherephassa Point]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So Ros' collar is the key to opening the gate to the underworld. Now to find a way to get it.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Kassandra reached Persephone first=\nKassandra's timely exit allowed her to reach Persephone first. Kassandra quickly glanced about the room as Persephone paced about it in circles, but saw no sign of Hekate. On hearing Kassandra's footsteps, the goddess was roused from her thoughts.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''So? What did you find out?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hekate's been working behind your back.''\nHekate arrived and overheard her remark.\n*'''Hekate:''' ''What folly is this? An outsider accusing ''me'' of treason? After breaking into ''your'' sanctuary?''\nPersephone stared daggers at Kassandra.\n|-|Hekate reached Persephone first=\nHekate's swift departure allowed her to reach Persephone first, putting her scheme against Kassandra into motion.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''So ''you'' are the one I couldn't trust. Hekate has told me all about your treachery - including your break-in into my sanctuary.''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\nHekate gave me a key to your sanctuary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I couldn't have gotten in if Hekate hadn't given me the key.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''But you ''did'' break in?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes. To steal a journal about the gate to the [[underworld]].''\n|-|Lie \u2013 Hekate broke into your sanctuary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hekate is trying to frame me. I had nothing to do with the break-in.''\n</tabber>\nPersephone turned to Hekate.\n*'''Persephone:''' ''You ''are'' the only one with the key.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Kassandra stole it from me. Just like she stole the last of Lethe's water from the cave.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra destroyed Lethe's water=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''But Kassandra destroyed it. Don't play games with me, Hekate. I know who was behind Lethe's water circulating in Elysium.''\n|-|If Kassandra gave out Lethe's water=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I know you were both involved in the distribution of Lethe's water. But ''you'' were the one who handed it to that woman.''\n</tabber>\nHekate looked at Kassandra.\n*'''Hekate:''' ''The point is, there's been trouble in Elysium ever since you got here. That's no coincidence. You're clearly trying to push Persephone out of power.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Hekate and I have been working together.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I may be working against Persephone, but you've been helping me the entire time.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''There, out of your own mouth! You're trying to overthrow me.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 Hekate is the traitor, not me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Half of Elysium knows Hekate wants you out of power, Persephone. Why can't you see that?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hekate:''' ''You can't believe these lies. A [[Isadore|silver tongue]] joined the delinquents operating in [[Deukalion's Heritage]] after this outsider helped her.''\n<tabber>\nSilver Tongue denounces Persephone=\n|-|Silver Tongue praises Hekate=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''I've heard her myself. She's singing your praises as an ally to humans.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''What? I...''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Start being honest, Hekate. And fast.''\n|-|Silver Tongue praises Adonis=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''The timing ''is'' curious...''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Furthermore, a gathering of your most devoted followers was recently targeted.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If the devotees were poisoned=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Yes, all poisoned with [[aconite]], which you have quite the green thumb for.''\n|-|If the devotees were not poisoned=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Yes... No one was hurt, but aconite was found in the wine. Your signature death sentence, if I recall correctly.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Curiously, the last of my batch was stolen from me right before the party.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It wasn't me.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''Is it a coincidence, then, outsider, that someone matching your description was seen fleeing from the Followers' symposium?''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Enough! I have reason to suspect the both of you of treason at this point. Hekate is my oldest friend in the underworld. And for a while, I thought, my truest. Give me one reason why I should believe your word over hers.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Hekate wants to turn you against me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is all part of her plan, but your instincts were right, Persephone. Hekate's the traitor.''\n|-|Hekate is trying to help you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Your quest for control is corrupting you.\" I heard her say that when you sent me to spy. That's why she's trying to undermine your reign.''\n|-|Hekate wants your throne.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hekate has always been jealous of you. She wants your power over Elysium for herself.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Hekate:''' ''You can't possibly take the word of an outsider over mine. Persephone?''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Persephone distrusts Hekate=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Whatever part Kassandra played in my misfortunes as of late, ''you'' played the larger role. And you are supposed to be my confidant in the underworld. My best friend.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''I had the best intentions.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Whatever you were trying to do, you betrayed me.''\n|-|If Persephone still trusts Hekate=\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Hekate's right. I'd have to be out of my mind to take your word over hers. Nothing's been paradise since you dropped in. You are no longer welcome in my palace.''\n</tabber>\nA servant ran up to them out of breath.\n*'''Servant to Persephone:''' ''We've received word those delinquents in Deukalion's Heritage are on the move.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Not now.''\n*'''Servant to Persephone:''' ''This is urgent, my queen.''\n*'''Persephone:''' ''Fine. I'll handle this later.''\nPersephone left to deal with the rebellion brewing outside her palace, leaving Kassandra and Hekate alone for the time being.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should have known you would stab me in the back.''\n*'''Hekate:''' ''You can't betray someone you never held any loyalty for.''\nHekate left. Kassandra left the palace to continue her efforts to help the rebellion.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra was tasked by Persephone to spy on Hekate at Iphigenia's Compound. It turned out Hekate was using Kassandra and wanted to blame her for everything. Hekate was also trying to gain control of Elysium for herself and revealed that the collar of Ros was the key to the underworld. Eventually, Persephone either sided with Hekate or Kassandra, based upon choices made during previous memories.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "The name of the memory is an allusion to the saying \"{{Wiki|No good deed goes unpunished}}\". It may also be a reference to the {{Wiki|No Good Deed (song)|song}} in the Broadway musical ''{{Wiki|Wicked (musical)|Wicked}}'', as there are [[Sudden and New|three]] [[Good News|other]] [[Popular|quests]] in the DLC that have a similar naming scheme, all of which are in Hekate's quest line.\n\nThis quest references previous choices made in Hekate's quest line. Some decisions made will either help or hurt Kassandra's argument against Hekate:\n*\"[[Good News]]\" \u2013 Instructing [[Isadore]] to sing Hekate's praises as an ally of the humans will be used against Hekate.\n*\"[[Have Another Drink]]\" \u2013 Destroying [[Lethe]]'s water during \"[[Have Another Drink]]\" helps Kassandra's argument.\n*\"[[Popular]]\" \u2013 Poisoning the devotees hurt Kassandra's argument even though Persephone will point out that it is Hekate's ''modus operandi'' regardless.\n\nIn addition, the following arguments will either strengthen or weaken Kassandra's argument against Hekate:\n*Lying about breaking into the sanctuary during \"[[Sudden and New]]\" strengthens Kassandra's argument. Telling the truth weakens it even though Persephone will point out that Hekate is the only one with the key regardless.\n*Admitting to working with Hekate weakens Kassandra's argument.\n*Of the three options for the final argument against Hekate:\n**\"Hekate wants to turn you against me\" is the weakest argument. This option is automatically available even if the player leaves immediately despite the fact its argument is based on information Kassandra learns from waiting one time.\n**\"Hekate wants your throne\" is the stronger argument. This option is automatically available even if the player leaves immediately despite the fact its argument is based on information Kassandra learns from waiting one time.\n**\"Hekate is trying to help you\" is the strongest argument, but it is only available if the player chooses \"[Wait]\" three times when eavesdropping on Hekate and Hermes, which also ensures that Kassandra gets caught. Reaching Persephone before Hekate gives more influence over Persephone than this argument. This option is not available if the player only chooses \"[Wait]\" two times before leaving despite the fact Kassandra directly quotes words from Hekate that she only needs to wait two times to hear.\n*Getting caught by waiting a third time or interrupting at any time will result in Hekate fleeing to reach Persephone first. This substantially harms Kassandra's argument but does not guarantee failure.",

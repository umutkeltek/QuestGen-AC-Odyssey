    "General_Description": "'''Deadly Little Secrets''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra entered the experimentation chamber to find out where the [[human]]s were taken.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra travelled to the [[Garden of Kymopoleia]], approaching the entrance to the chamber.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This looks like the perfect place to hide missing humans. Locked. But I think I know what opens this.''\nKassandra took out the two disk fragments and put them together. She then placed the completed disk on a small pedestal on the left, unlocking the gate.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The more complicated the key, the bigger the secret.''\nKassandra entered the vault and navigated her way through to a courtyard, which she found to be heavily guarded.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone really doesn't want any visitors.''\n[[File:ACOD Deadly Little Secrets - Kassandra Entering Laboratory.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra arriving at the laboratory]]\nAfter sneaking through, she arrived at a testing room, where she came upon replicas of the mythical creatures she encountered in [[Greece]], including the [[Minotaur]], the [[Cyclops]] [[Brontes]], the [[Writhing Dread]], and the [[Sphinx]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What... ''is'' this?''\nShe then turned around and found a tube containing numerous humanoid creatures.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1ka!\nShe then heard a voice talking to her.\n*'''[[Aita]]:''' ''I've been waiting for you, Kassandra. Welcome to the birthplace of legends.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who said that? Show yourself!''\n*'''Aita:''' ''My name is Aita. I am a scientist. And in many ways these are my children.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You created the minotaur, the cyclops, the writhing dread? They're monsters.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Are we not all monsters? Imperfect being striving towards our ultimate potential? Is that not why you are here?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm here to find missing humans.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here because a [[Alkon (Atlantis)|little boy]]'s parents are missing, and all signs point to you.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''How very human of you.''\n|-|I'm here as Dikastes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm here to judge Atlantis. And right now, things are not looking very good.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Look closer.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra watched in horror as the humanoid creatures were instantly liquified. She made a sound of disgust and flinched away. She briefly examined the trapped creatures, either recollecting her own experience with them or listening to Aita. First she approached Brontes' jar.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Grant us the sight...''\n*'''Aita:''' ''To protect our legacy.''\nKassandra moved on to the Writhing Dread's jar.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She nearly turned me to stone! Even now I don't feel safe staring at her.''\nShe continued to the Minotaur's jar.\n*'''Kassandra:''' I still have nightmares from my time in the Labyrinth.\nShe looked at a misshapen mass left in the [[Hekatonchires]]' spawn jar.\n*'''Kassandra''': ''Who... or ''what'' are you?''\nShe walked to the final jar in the gallery, this one holding a massive shard of [[adamant]].\n*'''Aita:''' ''A metal of extraordinary properties. Restructures the portion of the human brain responsible for emotions. We've engineered it to remove fear. Enhances your more animal instincts. Why hold a weapon, when you can become one?''\nOnce done, she proceeded further inside, fighting a group of the humanoid creatures along the way. Eventually, she reached another room.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Damades]]? [[Rhene]]? Are you here?''\n*'''Rhene:''' ''Over here! We're here!''\n[[File:ACOD Deadly Little Secrets - Captive Humans.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the human captives]]\nKassandra found them and numerous other humans held behind a barrier.\n*'''Damades:''' ''Please help us.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Lyra lived=\n*'''[[Lyra]]:''' Dikastes''! You're here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lyra? What are you doing here?''\n*'''Lyra:''' ''They came for me in the night. I'll never be safe.''\n|-|If Lyra died=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't worry, I'm getting everyone out of here.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Deadly Little Secrets - Aita Arrival.png|thumb|250px|Aita arrived]]\nAn individual approached Kassandra.\n*'''Aita:''' ''Didn't anyone teach you it's cruel to lie?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What? What's cruel is abducting and experimenting on these people.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Without sacrifice, there can be no progress. Without experimentation, there can be no perfection.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're breaking [[Poseidon]]'s law.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''I am advancing knowledge for the betterment of [[Atlantis]]. Poseidon's lack of vision keeps us in darkness. But we are close. So very close.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Humans are not rats.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Humans are not animals to be caged and tortured.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''We [[Project Anthropos|created]] them to serve us. That is their sole purpose.''\n|-|You're bringing war to Atlantis.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Atlantis is on the brink of war because of [[Isu]] who think like you.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Which is why we are properly arming ourselves.''\n|-|Knowledge shouldn't involve suffering.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The smartest people I've met don't resort to violence.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Did you not nearly raze [[Elysium]] to the ground in the pursuit of knowledge?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let these people go.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''It's too late for them. [[Project Olympos]] has already begun. One human escaped before the transformation was complete and lives were lost. This ''won't'' happen again. Surely you understand.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Lyra lived=\nAita looked at Lyra, who look down.\n|-|If Lyra died=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lyra. She took her own life after what you did to her.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Aita:''' ''So, you've seen the beast she becomes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm getting these people out of here.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''But... don't you want to know what's behind this door?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me what's behind the door.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll play. Tell me.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Why tell you when I could show you? Just know to enter the chamber is to forfeit their lives. You cannot have both.''\n|-|I don't care what's behind the door.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't play your little games. I'm getting these people out of here.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''So, you would choose to let your small-minded morality hinder your progress.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What if I just killed you, set these people free, and broke through your stupid door?''\n[[File:ACOD Deadly Little Secrets - Kassandra Tossing Spear.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra throwing her spear]]\nAita smiled. Kassandra threw her [[Spear of Leonidas|Spear]] at him. However, the spear simply phased through and dropped to the ground. Aita laughed.\n*'''Aita:''' ''You can't kill me, Kassandra.''\nAita began levitating. Kassandra walked over to her spear and stomped on it to flip it up to her waiting hand.\n*'''Aita:''' ''I can see you're struggling. What if I told you the greatest achievement in Atlantis is behind that door? And that we owe that achievement to you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you talking about?''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Through there is a path to immortality. For you. For us. Embrace your legacy\u2014forget these miserable humans. Abandon morality, and the answers to all your questions are just beyond that door.''\n*'''Rhene:''' ''Please! Save us or we'll die.''\nAita angrily phased through the barrier, threatening Rhene.\n*'''Aita:''' ''You will be reborn!''\nHe returned to Kassandra.\n*'''Aita:''' ''Don't you want to know why you're really here? Free the people and this door will remain closed to you forever. Pass through, however, and it will lock behind you\u2014these rats will be mine. What will it be, ''Dikastes,'' their lives, or your destiny?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I will go through the door.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sorry.''\n*'''Rhene:''' ''No! Please!''\n*'''Damades:''' ''Don't leave!''\nKassandra went through the door, discovering multiple clones of herself.\n[[File:ACOD - Deadly Little Secrets - clones.png|thumb|240px|Kassandra discovering clones of herself]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What? No... impossible.''\nAita spoke to Kassandra through voice as she looked through the clones.\n*'''Aita:''' ''You. It was always you. Human. Isu. Perfection. The [[Hybrid|Isu blood]] coursing through your human body makes you the perfect vessel. It has endowed you with their resilience, and our consciousness. More so than any of my creations, you are what Project Olympos was always meant to be. The ultimate weapon. Imagine if we controlled an ''army'' of you\u2014the inevitable [[Human-Isu War|war]] between the humans and the Isu would be over in a heartbeat.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nNot if I destroy your army.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not if I cut down every last one of these things.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Don't waste your energy. We can always create more.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThis \"Army\" is pathetic.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These \"vessels\" are empty. Your project has failed. And soon, you will be dead.''\n*'''Aita:''' ''Entertaining to the end.''\n}}\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These experiments have gone too far. Poseidon's going to hear about this.''\n|-|I will save these people.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fuck your door. I promised a little boy I'd bring his parents home, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.''\nKassandra moved towards the barrier while Aita sighed in disappointment.\n*'''Aita:''' ''Very disappointing. No matter. if there are two things Atlantis has in ample supply, it is adamant and humans.''\n[[File:ACOD Deadly Little Secrets - Kassandra Release Barrier.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra freeing the humans]]\nKassandra removed a power source on a pedestal near the barrier, deactivating it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come on, let's get out of here.''\n*'''Damades:''' ''Thank you, ''Dikastes.\n*'''Rhene:''' ''I'll get to see Alkon again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hurry!''\n[[File:ACOD Deadly Little Secrets - Kassandra Damades Rhene.png|thumb|250px|Damades and Rhene outside the chamber]]\nThe human captives escaped the chamber. As Kassandra directed the humans, [[Juno]] looked at her alongside Aita, before quickly disappearing through the door. Kassandra then followed the humans outside.\n*'''Rhene:''' ''How can we ever repay you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell your son if an Isu ever calls him a rat again, ''Dikastes'' Kassandra will deal with them personally.''\nRhene and Damades left.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Poseidon lied to me. They've been experimenting on humans this whole time.''\n</tabber>",

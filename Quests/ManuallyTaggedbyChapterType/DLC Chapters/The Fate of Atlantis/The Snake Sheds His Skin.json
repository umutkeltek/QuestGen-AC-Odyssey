    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled to the [[Lost Temple of Nyx]] to reconvene with [[Elpenor]] and confront the Monger. She donned the completed Armor of the Fallen and penetrated the Tartaros Veil, finding Elpenor already inside.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''You look fabulous. Now, let me tell you my plan to catch the Monger.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me the plan.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's hear it. I'm ready.''\n|-|You shouldn't be making the plans.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Last I checked, you needed help getting bloodstains out of your clothes. Should you really be coming up with strategies for storming temples?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Like it or not, I know the underworld and its enemies far better than you do. Try to work with me here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fine.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Exceptional. I'll distract the prisoners while you head straight to the Monger. We can't let him escape. Once you defeat him, take him to the deepest abyss of [[Tartaros]]. You'll have to pass through the [[Entrails of Gaia]] to get there.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Entrails of... Never mind, let's go.''\n\nKassandra and Elpenor drew their weapons and charged inside.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|(plan followed)=\nElpenor engaged the escaped prisoners and cleared the way for Kassandra to chase the Monger.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''Fuck!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Monger... Ugly in life, ugly in death.''\n*'''The Monger:''' ''I can't believe you're working with that fucking jellyfish, Elpenor! Ha! Took you long enough to find me, fuckface. What's the matter? Need the [[Courtesan|hetaerae]] to do your fighting for you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This time, I'll tear you to shreds.''\nKassandra killed his support and inflicted wounds on the Monger.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Hades]] wants you back in Tartaros where you belong.''\n*'''The Monger:''' ''Ha! Hades doesn't fuckin' care.''\nKassandra wounded him some more.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''You can't kill the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]].''\nKassandra inflicted deep wounds, enraging him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You fought better the first time I killed you''\n*'''The Monger:''' ''Fuck you!''\nKassandra reduced him to the last of his strength.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''I'm gonna do to you what I wanted to do to your [[Myrrine|mother]].''\nAfter a long battle, Kassandra finally subdued the Monger.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''No!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor's been waiting for your head.''\nKassandra confirmed the Monger was defeated and slung his body over her shoulder, carrying him out of the Lost Temple of Nyx.\n|-|(plan ignored)=\nKassandra ignored Elpenors plan and fought with him against the prisoners.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Thank you for the assistance, but as I told you, I can take care of these guards on my own.''\nTogether they defeated the gurads.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Get to the Monger like we planned!''\nAnother group of guards attacked and Kassandra attacked and defeated them, ignoring Elpenor ranting.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Kassandra! I told you I'd take are of these guards. Go, get the Monger!''\nA third group of enemies attacked the two, but they also were killed by Kassandra and Elpenor.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''What part of letting me handle the other prisoners didn't you understand? Let's get to the Monger - quickly now!''\nElpenor ran further into the temple in hope it wasn't to late to catch the Monger. Kassandra followed, only to find a frustrated Elpenor.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Don't tell me the Monger got away. I told you I would take care of his guards''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'll find the Monger.=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Don't worry. I'll find him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hades shouldn't be kept waiting on this. Find the Monger as soon as you can.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWatch your mouth.=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''You don't get to lecture me. Ever.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You - fine. Whatever you say, ''misthios''.''\n}}\nKassandra tracked down the Monger in the [[Stables of the Immortal Stallions]] and approached him.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''Ha! Took you long enough to find me, fuckface. What's the matter? Need the [[Courtesan|hetaerae]] to do your fighting for you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This time, I'll tear you to shreds.''\nKassandra wounded him some more.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''You can't kill the [[Cult of Kosmos|Cult]].''\nKassandra inflicted deep wounds, enraging him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You fought better the first time I killed you''\n*'''The Monger:''' ''Fuck you!''\nKassandra reduced him to the last of his strength.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''I'm gonna do to you what I wanted to do to your [[Myrrine|mother]].''\nAfter a long battle, Kassandra finally subdued the Monger.\n*'''The Monger:''' ''No!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Elpenor's been waiting for your head.''\nKassandra confirmed the Monger was defeated and slung his body over her shoulder and left towards the Entrails of Gaia.\n</tabber>\nKassandra journeyed through the Entrails of Gaia to the point above the deepest abyss of Tartaros. Kassandra cast the Monger into the abyss, and Elpenor joined her to take stock of their victory.\n<!--Dialogue varies significantly but always ends up at one of the two choices. I got the \"calmer\" dialogue after listening to his plan + following his plan + not leaving him behind in \"Arms of Atonement\", but it is possible to get the \"angry\" dialogue after the \"followed/broke the plan,\" which is its own line. \u2013 Kathargos-->\n<tabber>\n|-|Followed the plan=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''We make a good pair. At first I was worried you wouldn't stick to the plan\u2014you haven't been very trusting of me.''\n|-|Broke the plan=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''We had a plan to keep the Monger from escaping. You should have trusted me!''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Can you really blame me? You and the Cult destroyed my life.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Cleared path for Elpenor in Kronos' Treasury?=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I understand, but tell me you see that I've changed. That I'm trying to do good in death where I failed in life. I cannot move on without your acceptance.''\n|-|Abandoned Elpenor in Kronos' Treasury?=\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I have done nothing but try to redeem myself in your eyes. But still, you refuse to give me a chance.''\n</tabber>\n<tabber>\n|-|Kill \u2013 To Tartaros with you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've heard enough of your lies for two lifetimes.''\nKassandra swiftly kicked Elpenor off the cliff into the abyss of death below. Elpenor screamed while Hades simply clapped.\n*'''Hades:''' ''I always find it satisfying to best an adversary twice, don't you?''\n[[Poseidon]] joined them. Hades had won their wager regarding Elpenor's fate.\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''Enough gloating, brother. She already kicked him in the pit. You won the bet.''\nHe flipped Hades a coin.\n*'''Hades:''' ''Elpenor. What a useless pawn.''\n|-|I can see you've changed.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I suppose... you have changed. A bit.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''My dear Eagle Bearer, you have no idea what your forgiveness means to me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who said anything about forgiveness?''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''I feel as though I can finally move on.''\nHades joined them.\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Hades! I\u2014we returned the Monger to Tartaros for you, just as you asked.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''I made no such request.''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''But you referred to the Monger as a thorn in your side.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''And you inferred that I wanted him returned. Clearly you still have much to learn, Elpenor. We'll discuss this later at my [[Hades' Palace|palace]].''\n*'''Elpenor:''' ''Still, I'm on my way to eternal peace, thanks to you.''\nElpenor took his leave as [[Poseidon]] arrived to join Kassandra and Hades. He had won their wager regarding Elpenor's fate.\n*'''Poseidon:''' ''I believe you're forgetting something, brother?''\nHades flipped him a coin while staring down Kassandra.\n*'''Hades:''' ''Why would you help your enemy find peace?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I thought you and Elpenor were working together.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Elpenor was merely a means to further along ''your'' far more interesting journey.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any chance this means you'll teach me more about the [[Staff of Hermes Trismegistus|Staff]] now?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Patience, Keeper. A few more twists are still to come along your path. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all plays out.''\n<tabber>\n|-|This isn't theater.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''First Elpenor, now you. I am so sick of everyone using my life for their entertainment.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''It's far more than that.''\n|-|You're testing me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You used Elpenor as some sort of trial for me.''\n*'''Hades:''' ''Close. But the [[Fates]] wove your path with a defter hand than that.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What are you talking about?''\n*'''Hades:''' ''You'll know soon enough.''\nHades and Poseidon took their leave of Kassandra.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra defeated the Monger for a second time, this time casting him into the depths of Tartaros. She either sentenced Elpenor to the same fate or allowed him to continue his path of redemption.",

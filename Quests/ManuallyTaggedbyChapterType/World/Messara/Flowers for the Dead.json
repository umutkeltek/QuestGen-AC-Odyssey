[[Mercenary|Misthios]]!''\nKassandra approached the old man.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's on your mind, old man?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I'm dying, ''misthios''. I can feel it in my bones. But first, there's something I need to do. Will you help an old man fulfil his dying wish?<br>I can offer you what [[drachma]]e I have left.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't deny an old man his final wish. What is it?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I always promised my wife I'd take her to see the red flowers on the [[Summit of Mount Ida|summit]] of the [[Mount Ida|mountain]] in [[Zeus' Playground]]. It's a beautiful place\u2014great view.<br>But she met the [[Charon|ferryman]] before me, ''misthios''. I never made good on my promise.<br>It was always one thing or another, you know?<br>Children, war, what have you.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You should have made an effort.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you'd tried harder, she might have gotten to see the view.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I tell myself that every day.''\n|-|We all have regrets.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was a tough situation. You did your best.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''You're a kind soul, ''misthios''. But I failed her... I did.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So what do you want me to do?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I need you to pick some of those red flowers for me from the Summit of Mount Ida so I can take them to my wife when I meet [[Hades]].<br>Just a few would do. Bring them back to me here. I'll be waiting, ''misthios''. And\u2014<br>I don't have long.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I understand.''\nKassandra headed to Mount Ida and reached the summit.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the place the old man spoke of.''\nShe found the flowers among the bushes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There it is. The flower.''\nShe picked up the flowers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The flowers... I should hurry back to the old man near [[Gortyn]].''\nKassandra quickly returned to where the old man was at. There, she found a lady near a covered body instead.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hades claims another.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''In all my life, I've never seen him so peaceful. I hope he's found'' mater.<br>''Those flowers... Are they\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes. He asked me to fetch them.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''You silly old man. Is this why you left [[Pephka]]? To fetch ''mater'' flowers so far from home? You silly, stubborn, old man...''\n<tabber>\n|-|Here, take them.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here.''\nKassandra handed over the flowers.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Thank you so much,'' misthios.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He made a promise to his wife. And I made a promise to him.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I don't have anything to offer you\u2014''\n|-|I was promised compensation.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your father promised me his drachmae.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Oh. [[Veteran Breastplate|Here]], it's all he had on him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you, old man.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Civilian:''' Mater'' must be so glad you brought her flowers. You never did when she was alive...''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped the old man recover flowers for his wife, although he never lived long enough to see Kassandra return with them.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Though the in-game model of the flowers on Summit of Mount Ida resembles the [[Poppy|poppies]], the quest item image doesn't, nor the man's description of them as 'rare'.\n*If the flowers are merely given, the only reward for this quest is experience. If a reward is insisted on, the daughter gives the old man's [[Veteran Breastplate|armor]] and some drachmae.",

Come help me!''\nKassandra approached the man.\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''You've got to free me before those [[vulture]]s peck my eyes out! Not to mention the [[Wolf|wolves]]! I saw them in the bushes earlier.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You called me \"[[Mercenary|misthios]]\" \u2013 you must know my help comes at a price. You don't look like you're in much of a... position to pay.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''W-wait! Hear me out! The people who did this to me \u2013 they took everything I had and left me for dead! They've got plenty of other treasures and trinkets at their hideouts, too! Free me, and I'll tell you where to find them.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra had not raided the Followers' cave=\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll do it.\")\n|-|If Kassandra already raided the Followers' cave=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean the treasure at the Follower of Ares hideout?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''O-oh.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The treasure underwater? Yeah, I got it all. What else do you have to offer?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Well, no, there's more! ''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll do it.\")\n</tabber>\nKassandra moved to untie Pandaros.\n[[File:ACOd-BareItAll-wolves.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra fighting the wolves]]\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Quick, ''misthios''! Untie me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Mal\u00e1kes ''wolves!''\nA pack of wolves attacked Kassandra. She easily dispatched them and freed the man.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're alive ''and'' free. Now tell me about my reward.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Those ''mal\u00e1kes'' took my only prized possession. A family heirloom \u2013 an amulet handed down from my mother. They keep their spoils underwater in [[Cave of Rhea|a cave]] just west of here.''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra had not recovered the amulet.=\n(If \"Who took your amulet?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Which on of the thugs took your amulet?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''The \"''leader,''\"\u2014a burly man with a huge [[battleaxe|axe]] wears it now. Take his head, and the amulet is yours to keep.''\n[[File:ACOd-BareItAll-KassPand.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra talking with Pandaros]]\n(If \"Who left you here to die?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who left you like this?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''The Followers of Ares! I joined them thinking I could get rich quick. But the sacrifices and murders, ''misthios''... It's terrible. I tried to sneak away with some of their stuff\u2014''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And got caught.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''You've got to kill them all, ''misthios''. They're crazy.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou got yourself in trouble.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You deserted the Followers of Ares and expect to live? What's your plan?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''I assumed I'd become carrion. But wait! Maybe...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't like the sound of this.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''How... how about I work for you? I know how to fight! The Followers of Ares gave me that much, at least. What do you say?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou work for me now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK, you work for me now. I don't see much value in you... but it's better than nothing.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''I'll see you back at your ship then, Commander.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not before putting on some clothes!''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI don't need you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have no need for the likes of you. Go, ''mal\u00e1kas''! Or I'll take care of you like I did the wolves.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Y-yes! Right away.''\nPandaros left.\n}}\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLeave \u2013 \"That's enough.\"=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let the hunt begin.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''! Knowing that they are dead will help me sleep easier.''\n}}\nKassandra headed west to the cave Pandaros mentioned.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here we are.''\n[[File:ACOd-BareItAll-FoAbruteKass.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra sneaking up on the brute]]\nShe entered the cave and navigated her way through the complex. Along the way, she eliminated members of the Followers of Ares. In the furthermost chamber, she found the brute Pandaros had described, and overheard him admiring the amulet.\n*'''Mercenary:''' ''This amulet will work perfectly. My love will look beautiful in this.''\nShe slew the Follower, and recovered the amulet.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the amulet the naked man was going on about. Looks expensive.''\n|-|If Kassandra already recovered the amulet=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You mean this amulet?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Why, yes!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are there any other valuables?''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''Uh...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's not called freedom because it's free. I'd say you owe me for my services.''\n*'''Pandaros:''' ''How... how about I work for you? I know how to fight! The Followers of Ares gave me that much, at least. What do you say?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou work for me now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''OK, you work for me now.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra freed the man and learned the location of a Followers of Ares hideout full of trinkets and a stolen necklace.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*Though Kassandra claims Pandaros called her ''misthios'', he only address her as such after she mentions it.\n*Pandaros will still provide a description of the cave and its location even if Kassandra had looted it before rescuing him.\n*If Pandaros is recruited, he remains just as naked aboard the ''[[Adrestia]]'' as in Messara, despite Kassandra telling him to put on clothes.\n*Instead of being dubbed 'priest' or 'fanatic' like other Followers of Ares, the brute is dubbed as 'mercenary' in the subtitles.",

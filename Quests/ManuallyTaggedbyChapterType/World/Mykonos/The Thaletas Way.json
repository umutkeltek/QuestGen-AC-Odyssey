    "General_Description": "'''The Thaletas Way''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Thaletas]] at his camp after the meeting with [[Kyra]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "After the meeting between Kyra and Thaletas, Kassandra returned to the Spartan camp, where Thaletas gave a rousing speech to his men from the deck of a wrecked ship.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Spartans! Many brothers were lost to the Athenian dogs. But we are still here!<br />The Battle of the [[Battle of Thermopylae|Three Hundred]]? [[Leonidas I of Sparta|Leonidas]] was lucky to have that many men!<br />Today we honor the fallen. Today we send our enemies to [[Hades]]!<br />Kyra will fight and die for her people. We will do the same!<br />We don't go home until these islands are ours. [[Delos]] called. Sparta answered!''\nKassandra climbed aboard to Thaletas' side and clapped.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Kyra's plan=\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Kassandra, I didn't think you'd come here after calling my plan a suicide mission.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And miss your speech? Never.''\n|-|Thaletas' plan=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A fine speech.''\n</tabber>\nRegardless, Thaletas resented the \"speech\" remark.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Athenians give speeches. Spartans give orders.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt - What orders would you give me?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I was under your command, what would you order me to do?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Same thing I order my men. Bruised, bloody, or broken, never hold back.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI never hold back.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I never hold back.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I can tell.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wasn't talking about fighting.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I know, and I'm tempted.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''But I sailed here for Kyra. She's the one I fight for... for now.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nSo you like things rough.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bruised, bloody, or broken? That can be arranged.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''My heart beats faster, ''misthios.'' But...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''But I sailed here for Kyra. She's the one I fight for... for now.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nHard shell, soft center.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You act tough. But I'm sure there's a softer side to you.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''That's why Spartans carry shields.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shields have never stopped me.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You're a bold one, ''misthios''. But Kyra needs us.''\n}}\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, if you're going to win these islands for her, you'll need more soldiers.''\n|-|Let's plan our next move.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your men are brave, but they won't be enough. We need those reinforcements.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''They'd never get here alive. The Athenian navy is too powerful, and our\u00a0ship is at the bottom of the sea.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Adrestia|Mine]] isn't.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You'd confront them in open waters? Not sure if you're brave or just mad.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Challenge accepted.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Adrestia and I have faced greater challenges than a few Athenian ships.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You fight like [[Achilles]] reborn, but even you couldn't defeat the entire navy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But if I sink enough ships, the Spartans can get through.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''There's something else. A helmet was left on board my ship. It was my pater's.''\n(If the helmet was already acquired)\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI already have your helmet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You wouldn't be talking about this helmet, would you?''\nShe handed over the helmet.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You found it! This saved me more times than I can count.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLie - We'll see.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll sink the ships, but I'm not making any promises about a helmet.''\n}}\n|-|I'll sink the ships later.\n\n</tabber>\n\n(else)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll sink the ships, but I'm not making any promises about a helmet.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|How many Athenian ships should I sink?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've been here long enough - how many ships protect Delos?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You'll never sink them all. We just need to punch a hole in their patrols, enough to send them scrambling.''\n|-|What's so special about the helmet?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So the helmet from your ''pater'' means a lot to you?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''It does. He pried it from his ''pater'' on the battlefield of [[Hot Gates of Thermopylai|Thermopylai]].''\n|-|Where did your ship sink?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The sea's a big place. Where did your ship sink exactly?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Somewhere off the northern coast of [[Mykonos]]. We could see [[Miltiades Fort]] as we swam to shore.''\n|-|I know what to do.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Great white shark|sharks]] will have full bellies when I'm done.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD The Thaletas Way 4.png|thumb|250px|The ''Adrestia'' preparing to attack an Athenian ship]]\nKassandra set sail and sank an Athenian ship.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're food for the sharks now, Athenians!''\nShe sank another.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas sends his regards, Athenian scum!''\nShe sank a third.\n*'''[[Barnabas]]:''' ''By [[Ares]], that should do it! Though, if we sink more, the Athenian forces will crumble.''\n\nKassandra returned to Thaletas victorious.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You're back! I overheard fishermen telling tales of the Adrestia cutting through the sea.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Athenian navy is scrambling.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Ha! Let their blood feed the sharks.''\n\n(If the helmet was recovered)\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Here's your helmet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's more. I have your helmet right here. Take it.''\nShe handed over the helmet.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''It saved me more times than I can count. Thank you.''\n|-|Lie - I didn't find your helmet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't thank me yet. Your father's helmet is gone.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I... can't even remember his face anymore. That helmet was all I had left of him. But, you broke the navy. That will be my vengeance.''\n</tabber>\n\n(If the helmet was not recovered)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't thank me yet. Your father's helmet is gone.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I... can't even remember his face anymore. That helmet was all I had left of him. But, you broke the navy. That will be my vengeance.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|We're not done yet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Athenians will retaliate for what I've done, unless we hit them first.''\n|-|You have heart.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have heart, but your troops are your family now. The Athenians will want to kill all of us for what I've done.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Then we need to strike first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Exactly.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''If that's the plan, we attack their commanders. Athenians are sheep. Kill the shepherd, and the flock will flee.''\n(Accept - \"I'll kill the commanders.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''March on them and they'll see you coming. I work better alone. I'll take care of these commanders.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You're going straight for their throats.''\nHe paused for a moment.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Still... leave some Athenian blood for me.''\n[[File:ACOD The Thaletas Way 9.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Thaletas discuss the Athenian commanders]]\n(If players asked \"Where are the Athenian commanders?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I need to know where to find them.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Kyra's spies tracked all three of them. One guards the [[Suenites Quarry|quarry]]. One's camped [[Leleges Military Camp|nearby]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And the third?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Him, we don't know.''\n(If players asked \"What are their names?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I want names, Thaletas.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''[[Tisandros]] commands the Athenian elite guard. [[Polemion]] is their strategist. And the last, a general named [[Neokles]], is missing.''\n(Leave - \"I know what I have to do.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When the commanders are dead, and more Spartans arrive, there will be plenty of blood for both of us.''\nThaletas took his leave of Kassandra.",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra punched a hole in the Athenian naval patrols, allowing Spartan reinforcements to slip through and land on Mykonos.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*The player can equip [[Thaletas' Helmet]] as a Rare-grade helmet, if it is found during this quest but withheld from him. The \"quest item\" version of the helmet can still be given to Thaletas at the end of [[Paint the Sand Red]], which removes it as a quest item in the player's inventory while retaining the wearable \"copy\" that the game generated for the player's use. The helmet can be very useful, given its default engraving of \"+% Chance to Ignore Half Damage.\"\n*The flirting dialog option \"So you like things rough.\" is not available if Kassandra lied to Thaletas and told him she's not Spartan when they first met during mission [[Trouble in Paradise]].",

Kill her!''\nThe guards were no match for her.\n*'''Podarkes:''' ''You will die for standing against us, ''child!\nPodarkes fought well, but Kassandra eventually inflicted significant wounds on him.\n*'''Podarkes:''' ''You've been a thorn in my side since you landed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Soon I'm going to be a blade in your throat.''\n*'''Podarkes:''' ''Even if you kill me, you will lose, Eagle Bearer. We are everywhere. There isn't a rock you can hide under where we won't find you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You are the snakes who hide! I'm going to bury you so deep only [[Hades]] will find you.''\nAfter a struggle, Kassandra disabled Podarkes.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was for my family, ''mal\u00e1ka.\nShe readied to deliver the final blow before hearing his last words.\n<tabber>\n|-|If \"M\" for Murder was not completed=\n*'''Podarkes:''' ''What I did, I did for the glory of Delos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You acted alone, and you will die alone.''\n|-|If '\"M\" for Murder' was completed=\n*'''Podarkes:''' ''Tell my [[Kyra|daughter]]...

He'll have only one retainer and will likely aggro the [[Sparta]]n guard outside as soon as he is loaded into the player's vicinity.\n*Killing Podarkes will still deduct -200 Nation Power, even after the bar is refilled upon Sparta taking control, as he is still flagged as a Nation Leader.",

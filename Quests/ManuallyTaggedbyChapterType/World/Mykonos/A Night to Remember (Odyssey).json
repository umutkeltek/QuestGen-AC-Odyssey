    "Section_Dialogue": "===Barnabas===\nAs the festivities began, Kassandra met with [[Barnabas]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The people are happy.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''As they should be! For the first time since Ares cursed us with war, the Delos Islands know freedom.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But where is Kyra? It's not like her to miss a chance to drink with her troops.''\n\n(If players kept her [[\"M\" for Murder|secret]])\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''She told me you kept her secret... I'm still shocked. Podarkes was a complicated man, but he was still her father. She snuck off to send him to the Ferryman alone.''\n\n(If players revealed her secret)\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''I haven't seen her celebrate with her troops since you revealed her past. She's gone to send her father to the Ferryman alone.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Podarkes deserves a warrior's burial.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All good warriors deserve their sendoff, I suppose. Even Podarkes.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Pray that we're shown the same kindness when our time comes. In the meantime, there is wine to be drunk, and tales to be told.''\n|-|The man deserves to rot.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If Podarkes were my family, I'd have tied him to a tree and left him to rot.''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''You and many others on Delos. But, this is still more celebration than funeral. There's wine to drink, and tales to tell.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra laughed.\n\n(On good terms with Thaletas?)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Make the tale great. The troops deserve it. Thaletas especially.''\n(On poor terms with Thaletas?)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Make the tale great. The troops deserve it. Even Thaletas.''\n\n(No one romanced)\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Indeed he does! He's just up the stairs, that way. I've been meaning to tell him how I lost this eye.''\n(Kyra or Thaletas romanced)\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Certainly... if you can find him. And when you do, remind him\u2014I still plan to tell him how I lost this eye.''\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra leaving to enjoy the festivities]]\nRegardless, Kassandra asked about the crew.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And the crew? Ready to sail?''\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''On your order. But first, let the crew enjoy a drink and a song. You deserve one, too.''\nKassandra leaves Barnabas for Kyra and Thaletas.\n\n(If [[Kasos]] was saved during [[the Sokratic Method]])\n\nA boy standing in the plaza in front of [[Tavern, Mykonos|the Tavern]] waved at Kassandra.\n*'''Aeson''': ''Misthios! Over here!''\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra speaking to Aeson, the son of the captured rebel]]\nKassandra approached and spoke to the boy.\n*'''[[Aeson]]:''' ''Sokrates said you're the one who saved my pater!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That lunati... rebel way your pater?''\n*'''Aeson:''' ''They had them and you saved them!''\n<tabber>\n|-|It was nothing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He needed saving. I saved him''\n*'''Aeson:''' ''That's not true. You're a hero!''\n\n|-|You shouldn't be here=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your pater was't like the other rebels. I don't know if they'd welcome him here. You're not safe.''\n*'''Aeson:''' ''It's all right now! Sokrates said the fighting is over, and Delians can all be friends again.''\n</tabber>\n(If players asked \"Where is your family?\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're here, where are your parents?''\n*'''Aeson:''' ''Mater's at home. I told her we were safe, but she says we have to leave now - that the bad people will come for us.''\n\n(If player asks \"What are you doing here?\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not safe. The rebels are drinking and getting rowdy.''\n*'''Aeson:''' ''They said they're building a school. I'm going to learn to read legends of heroes like you!''\n\n(Leave - \"Go enjoy the celebration.)\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Chaire. And try to stay out of trouble.''\n\n===Podarkes' Funeral===\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 4.png|thumb|250px|Kyra at her father's funeral pyre]]\nKassandra made her way to Kyra, who had prepared a funeral pyre for Podarkes. Kassandra handed her an obol.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For the [[Charon|ferryman]].''\nKyra accepted the coin and stepped forward with a torch in hand. She tossed the coin onto Podarkes's corpse.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Go now, into the river of black night, and embrace the boundless gloom. You shall wander obscure even in the house of Hades, flitting among the shadowy dead.''\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 6.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra and Kyra watched as Podarkes' body burned]]\nShe said this as she lit the bonfire, casting the torch aside when done. She steeled herself as Podarkes burned.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You shouldn't have to say goodbye alone.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I'm glad I'm not alone. I've wanted to watch him burn for so long. Now that it's happened... I thought I'd feel peace.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what ''do'' you feel?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I used to feel vengeful... Now... empty.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|He's dead. Move on.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's dead, and nothing we can do will bring him back.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''We? ''We'' didn't kill him. You did. I had a chance to say goodbye to him and you took it from me. The gods demanded justice ''from me''.''\nKyra's grief came to a head.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nForget the gods.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right here, right now, all that matters are the people who have fought for you. They need you now\u2014not the gods.''\nKassandra's words encouraged Kyra, and she resolved to live.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThen offer a sacrifice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the gods are displeased, offer them a sacrifice.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''A sacrifice... What do I have left that they haven't taken from me?''\nKyra's grief overwhelmed her.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're ungrateful.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''People gave their lives for you, Kyra. I nearly gave my own. The gods have blessed you, and you don't even see it.''\n*'''Kyra:''' No one'' can see what the gods do. They tricked me into wanting him dead. They tormented my thoughts until I could think of nothing else. And now, I see them laughing at me.''\nKyra's grief overwhelmed her.\n}}\n|-|I felt the same way, once.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I was in your place, once. The vengeance dies, then the emptiness dies too. Give it time.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Time! I've given my entire life. I want it done! Kronos devours his children\u2014rips them flesh from bone. Zeus had Prometheus torn open by birds for an eternity. Fate is cruel, and the gods are wicked.''\nKyra's grief came to a head.\n{{#tag:tabber|\nForget the gods.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right here, right now, all that matters are the people who have fought for you. They need you now\u2014not the gods.''\nKassandra's words encouraged Kyra, and she resolved to live.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nThen offer a sacrifice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the gods are displeased, offer them a sacrifice.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''A sacrifice... What do I have left that they haven't taken from me?''\nKyra's grief overwhelmed her.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're ungrateful.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''People gave their lives for you, Kyra. I nearly gave my own. The gods have blessed you, and you don't even see it.''\n*'''Kyra:''' No one'' can see what the gods do. They tricked me into wanting him dead. They tormented my thoughts until I could think of nothing else. And now, I see them laughing at me.''\nKyra's grief overwhelmed her.\n}}\n|-|Find a new purpose.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's gone, but you're still here. The people need you. If you don't protect them, there will be another Podarkes to come and take his place.''\nKassandra's words encouraged Kyra, and she resolved to live.\n</tabber>\n\n====Kyra lives====\n(If Kyra's secret was kept.)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You're right. They do need me. And I need them. We're rebels with nothing left to rebel against. They need me now more than ever.''\n(If Kyra's secret was revealed.)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''They don't need me. You made sure none of them would ever trust me again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We all have complicated pasts, Kyra. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Your family\u2014your ''real'' family, is celebrating tonight in your honor.''\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 7.png|thumb|250px|Kyra motivated to the lead the rebels again]]\n*'''Kyra:''' ''We're rebels with nothing left to rebel against. That's not much to start a family on... but it's more than I ever had. You're right.''\nKassandra nodded, and the two hugged.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Thank you.''\n(If players asked \"What will you do now?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What will you do next? Mykonos will need to rebuild.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Then that's what we'll do. But not to put it back as it was... not as ''pater'' wanted. We'll make this place a new home for our people to be free. To live good lives.''\n(Leave \u2013 \"Let's go to the celebration.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyra... He's gone. Your rebels are waiting.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''They're celebrating. Let's celebrate with them.''\nThey wrapped their arms across each other's shoulders and stared at the pyre a while longer before heading to the celebration.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Goodbye, ''pater''.''\n\n====Kyra dies====\nKassandra was at a loss for what to say next. While she was contemplating, she did not notice Kyra walk to the edge of the cliff.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyra, stop. You're too close to the edge.''\n(Secret kept)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Nothing. All of this was for nothing. I'm a rebel with nothing left to rebel against. It didn't bring [[Dianthe|her]] back.''\n(Secret revealed)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Nothing. All of this was for nothing. You made sure of that... and now nothing will bring her back.''\n\nKassandra was confused.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Her? Who?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Curse our cruel gods. I will see you, ''mater''. And ''pater''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyra! Stop!''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''No shame. No pain. We will be together again.''\nShe threw herself off the cliff to her death.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyra!''\nKassandra looked down to the cliff's bottom with grief in her expression. She later climbed down to the shore and found Kyra's corpse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Rest in [[Elysium]], Kyra.''\n\n===Thaletas on the Beach===\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 9.png|thumb|250px|Thaletas found by Kassandra by the beach]]\nKassandra encountered Thaletas on a small circular beach leading offshore, far away from the celebration.\n\n====Kyra romance====\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas. What are you doing out here?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Thinking. Praying. This was my time, Kassandra.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What?''\n\n(If Kyra's secret was kept)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''This glory was supposed to be mine, but you took everything from me. You took Podarkes. You took these islands. You took Kyra, my love!''\n\n(If Kyra's secret was revealed)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You took everything from me. You took Podarkes. You took these islands. This glory was supposed to be mine.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't \"take\" anything!''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Even after you tried to turn the rebels against her, Kyra still chose you over me!''\n\n(If romance with Thaletas pursued, then Kyra chosen)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''This glory was supposed to be mine. Podarkes was mine to kill. These islands were mine to win for Sparta. You were mine, and Kyra took you from me!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Calm down.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Be reasonable, Thaletas.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I tried to be reasonable. I am not reasonable. I. Am. Spartan.''\n\n|-|(If Kyra committed suicide) \u2013 Kyra is dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas. Listen to me. Kyra is dead.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''What? No! You... you killed her?''\n\nThaletas screamed in rage and agony.\n|-|No one is yours.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No one belongs to you, Thaletas. I didn't take your glory, I helped you.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You did nothing! We were in love, you know. We can be again... I can still have her heart, still prove to her I'm the warrior she wants.''\n</tabber>\nRegardless, Thaletas showed his jealous true colors and attacked Kassandra, leaving her no choice but to kill him.\n\n====Thaletas romance====\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas. What are you doing out here?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Thinking... Praying... We should talk.''\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 10.png|thumb|250px|Thaletas trying to pursuade Kassandra to leave her crew and aid the Spartans]]\nHe turned to face the west-southwest.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Sparta's that way. Just past the crests of the waves. I can almost hear her singing us home.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Us? Thaletas...''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Leave your crew... Come with me. Join my side, and we can win glory for Sparta together.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I wish I could.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd love to join you, if I could. But you're a Spartan general now, and I have my own destiny.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I know it's crazy. But I came to these islands expecting nothing but death.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''And then I found you. I know you have your life to live, and I want you to live it. Who knows, maybe the Fates will bring us together again one day...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But not today.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''My troops are going to start looking for me soon. I'll see you at the celebration.''\n\n|-|Or... You join my crew.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't sail by anyone's side, Thaletas. You know that by now.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you wanted true glory, true freedom, you are welcome to join me on the Adrestia.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You have my love, Kassandra, but Sparta has my heart. Perhaps, one day...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But not today.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I should be with my men. I'll see you at the celebration.''\n\n|-|Never going to happen.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Me? By your side? That's why you're out here?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You... you don't feel the same.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was one night, Thaletas.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''But... after everything you said to me, everything we shared, I thought...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You think too much.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''I came to these islands expecting death, but I never expected to feel this pain.''\nThaletas curled his lower lip and shook his head.\n*'''Thaletas:''' Chaire.\n</tabber>\nRegardless, duty compelled the two Spartan lovers to part ways.\n\n===Celebration===\nKassandra made her way to the celebration. She passed by [[Praxos]].\n*'''Praxos:''' ''Podarkes is dead because of you. We owe you that.''\n[[Herodianos]] also had kind words for her.\n*'''Herodianos:''' ''What a glorious battle! It was an honor to fight by your side, Eagle Bearer.''\n:(If [[The Sokratic Method]] is complete)\n:Sokrates was also present at the celebration, with a series of wise words for Kassandra.\n:*'''Sokrates:''' ''Life is only worth living if we spend our time examining our choices, wouldn't you agree?''\n:*'''Sokrates:''' ''Only by accepting you know nothing at all, can one truly know wisdom.''\n:*'''Sokrates:''' ''Relax, and enjoy your time in this world. There is nothing more barren than a busy life.''\n:*'''Sokrates:''' ''My intent is never to fill your head as one fills a cup with wine, but to ignite in you a flame that will burn brightly on its own.''\n:*'''Sokrates:''' ''Why not enjoy the celebration a while?''\n: (If Kasos is alive)\n:*'''Kasos:''' ''I'll won't stop fighting until Delos is free, or I die. Thanks to you, it's looking good for Delos.''\n\n====Kyra and Thaletas alive====\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 11.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra met with Kyra and Thaletas at the celebration]]\nKassandra spotted Kyra and Thaletas at the celebration and spoke to them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There you are. You look happy.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I said goodbye to the past, with your help. Now we welcome what the Fates will bring.''\n\n(Thaletas not romanced)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You were there when Kyra needed you. You're an ally to Sparta, and to our islands.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I wanted to be there for Kyra.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wanted to be there for Kyra. She needed me. You needed me.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Right... Well, did you hear about Thaletas? Sparta is calling him home. They intend to make him a general.''\n|-|Your... islands.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' Your'' islands. So, the rebels are now the rulers?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''One thing at a time. First, we celebrate. Besides, Sparta is calling Thaletas home. They intend to make him a general.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD A Night to Remember 12.png|thumb|250px|Thaletas volunteering to remain and aid Kyra in rebuilding Delos]]\n(Secret kept)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''And I've already told them no. My place is here, on Delos, rebuilding my home with the woman I love.''\n(Secret revealed)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''But I'm staying here. Since you showed us Kyra's past, it's made us closer.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Closer.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''He told me his place is here, on our islands, rebuilding our home, and our love.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You deserve to be happy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You earned this celebration, and all the prosperity the gods will bring.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''The gods gave me more than enough. Any prosperity is for the people of the islands, not us.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Thank you, Kassandra. We owe you our lives.''\n|-|You owe me for this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You owe me... both of you.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''We will live forever in your debt. What we rebuild, we rebuild in your honor. Thank you, Kassandra.''\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra bid them farewell.\n\n(Thaletas romanced)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Kassandra, about what I said at the beach...''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Not in front of Kyra!=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Um... Thaletas, maybe now's not the best time...''\n|-|Please. Just forget it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas, please, just forget it.''\n</tabber>\n\nRegardless, Kyra brushed it off.\n\n(Secret kept)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Relax. I'm glad you two had your fun. You taught him a thing or two.''\n(Secret revealed)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Relax. Thaletas tells me everything. And now, thanks to you, he knows everything about me. I'm glad you two had your fun.''\n\nRegardless, Thaletas changed his plans.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Kyra and I have decided I'm going to stay here, with her, and help rebuild what was lost in the rebellion.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Yes. We ''have''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I'm glad you two are together. And... happy. May Artemis and Apollo guide you as you govern your islands.''\n\nNo matter what, only death could separate the rebel and the Spartan. Kassandra bid them farewell.\n\n====Kyra alive====\nWith Thaletas dead in his own jealousy, only Kyra was present at the celebration. Kassandra spoke to her.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Thanks for being with me back there. I needed you.''\nThey embraced.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wanted to be. You know that.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Oh! Did you hear? They're promoting Thaletas to general, and sending him back to Sparta in the morning.''\nKassandra rubbed her neck with discomfort.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Thaletas is dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas is... dead. He attacked me on the beach. Because of us.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''He what? No! Why would he... Thaletas! You fool.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You stubborn, bull-headed, glorious fool.''\nShe turned her grief against Kassandra.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''And you just had to kill him, didn't you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He left me no choice.''\n(If Kyra's secret was kept)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I sent out two notes, and who responds? Thaletas the Spartan, and Kassandra the Eagle Bearer. I never imagined you'd both bring me so much sorrow.''\nShe uncorked a small flask and took a drink.\n\n(If Kyra's secret was revealed)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''The same way you didn't have a choice about giving me ''pater's'' doll in front of my men? My family?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They deserved the truth.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You broke my heart. You killed my... Podarkes, and now you killed Thaletas. The sooner you leave Mykonos the better.''\n\nRegardless, Kassandra gave a weak apology.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyra, I'm sorry.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''So am I, ''misthios''. So am I.''\n|-|Lie \u2013 He'll make a great general.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That is what he deserves... May he sail safely to his distant shore.''\nKyra's tone turned sad.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I sent out two notes, and who responds? Kassandra, the mighty Eagle Bearer, and Thaletas, a Spartan.''\nShe uncorked a small flask and took a drink in toast. Afterwards, she perked up.\n\n(If Kyra's secret was kept)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''He's gone now, but we're together, like Artemis and Apollo, like Mykonos and Delos. And the people are celebrating us.''\n\n(If Kyra's secret was revealed)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I lost my father. I almost lost my family, after what you did.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They deserved the truth.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Yes, and I'm glad they know. The truth brought us closer together.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''They've even fallen for you, as I have. And they are celebrating us.''\n\nRegardless, Kassandra reminded her of her departure.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They are. But soon, I'll set sail.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Let the Fates come when they may. Tonight, Kassandra, we are together. All of us. One family. One rebellion.''\n</tabber>\n\n====Thaletas alive====\nWith Kyra having taken her own life, only Thaletas was present at the celebration. Kassandra spoke to him.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''It's over. Blood spilled, battles won. They made me general, you know. Just told me. You deserve the rank more than anyone here.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I do deserve it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I deserve that and more for what I've done on these islands.''\n|-|You deserve to be general.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''General? Looks good on you, Thaletas. You deserve it.''\n</tabber>\n\n(If not romanced)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Too true! I only wish my Kyra were here to celebrate. I'm going to ask her to sail with me back to Sparta tonight.''\n\n(If romanced)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Too true!''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Even if we can't be together, I will sail home to Sparta with you in my heart.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''And before I go, I should say goodbye to Kyra.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Lie \u2013 Kyra will be here... later.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kyra... can't make it for now.''\nShe scratched her neck and looked away briefly.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But she said we should celebrate without her.''\nShe grabbed a cup of wine.\n\n(Secret kept)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Can't make it?''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''That woman is full of surprises.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''You certainly proved that when you exposed her past.''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Ah, well!''\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Our first drink will be to Kyra, then.''\nHe grabbed a cup and held it high in toast.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To Kyra.''\nShe took a swig with a wistful expression.\n\n(Secret revealed)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''Celebrate without her? Impossible!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But, let's try.''\nHe grabbed a cup and held it high in toast.\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''To victory, and too Sparta.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To victory.''\nShe took a swig with a wistful expression.\n|-|Kyra's dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thaletas, listen to me. Kyra... she took her life.''\n(Secret kept)\n*'''Thaletas:''' ''She what? No. No! Gods curse these Delians.

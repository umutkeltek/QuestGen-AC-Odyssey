    "General_Description": "'''Bleeding Hearts and Stolen Money''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Meeting [[Kyra]] again, Kassandra had an idea about how to cause more mayhem for [[Podarkes]]' forces.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra returned to the [[Porphyrion Cave]] to meet with Kyra about their next move. She overheard her speaking to [[Praxos]] about Kassandra's [[Kyra with a Cause|previous]] actions.\n*'''Praxos:''' ''Scouts came back from [[Delos]]. The ''misthios'' likes to set fires.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''She just might be the answer to our prayers.''\n*'''Praxos:''' ''She's only mortal.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''From what I've heard, she's much more.''\nKassandra spoke to them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Athens|Athenians]] are weak. Now we strike Podarkes where he'll hurt most.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''His kidneys?''\nThe two women burst out laughing while Praxos face-palmed and walked off.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt - I'm happy to see you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's good to see you, Kyra.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Since you came here, I've actually started to believe we can win this rebellion. So... you were saying we strike?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Guard]]s protect the island's treasury in one location. If we find it and steal it, the soldiers go unpaid, unfed, and unarmed. Podarkes will finally be vulnerable.''\n|-|Let's discuss our next move.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Delos keeps its wealth in one place, under constant guard. We steal it, and the soldiers will go unpaid, unfed, and unarmed. Podarkes will be vulnerable.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD Bleeding Hearts and Stolen Money 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra suggesting to steal the nation's chest]]\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Then we can stick our blades in between his ribs... Feed his liver to the [[dog]]s.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Before we start feeding organs to animals, can you get me to the nation's purse?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Our spies have located it in [[Miltiades Fort]]. I'll have Praxos gather the troops.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's best if it's just the two of us. Easier to sneak in and out undetected.''\n\n(Romance conditions met)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You just want me all to yourself, don't you? Let's get going then.''\n(Romance conditions not met)\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Good thinking. Let's move.''\n\nThe two made their way to the fort on foot.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Victory is close. I can feel it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We haven't won yet. The fort will be treacherous, and the gods can be fickle.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''It was the gods who sent you to me\u2014I refuse to believe they'd send you here to die. So, what do you think of our [[Silver Islands|islands]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think I prefer [[Mykonos]]. They really don't like you shedding blood on Delos.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''The priests are so terrified of desecrating the sacred grounds of [[Apollo]], women about to give birth are shipped over to Mykonos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What happens if they don't make it to shore?''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Boat babies.''\n\nAs they drew near the fort, [[Ikaros]] located the nation chest.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The nation's treasure, ripe for the picking.''\nKassandra and Kyra parted at the fort's entrance.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I'll keep an eye out for reinforcements.<br />And don't you die on me!''\nKassandra crossed the rubble into the fort and took note of the guards.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Guards everywhere. I need to be careful.''\nShe commented on the decrepit conditions of the fort.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This fort has seen better days. They should have spent some of that silver on upkeep.''\nShe eventually made her way the chest and pilfered its contents.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Done! Kyra's going to want to see this.''\n:Alternatively, Kassandra realized she had already looted this very chest earlier.\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''I already looted Delos' treasury. Kyra should hear about this.''\n[[File:ACOD Bleeding Hearts and Stolen Money 4.png|thumb|250px|Kyra awaiting Kassandra]]\nKassandra escaped the fort and returned to Kyra, keeping watch from a nearby cliff.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Kassandra, there you are! Good news, I hope?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When the people of Delos discover Podarkes lost every coin of their nation's treasure, they're going to rip him to pieces!''\n:(Alternatively)\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have a surprise. The treasury was already looted... by me. I'm surprised the soldiers haven't already ripped Podarkes to pieces!''\n\nRegardless, Kyra was elated to hear the news.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You've weakened Athens' grip over Delos, exposed Podarkes, and made way for a [[Sparta]]n alliance. I could kiss you!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt \u2013 Why don't you?=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't see anything holding you back.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You breathe life into me. If only you'd arrived on Delos before [[Thaletas]].''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nOh, I didn't realize.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You and Thaletas? But the way you were at each other's throats in the cave...''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''He's a stubborn, arrogant, glory-hungry Spartan!''\nKassandra glanced from side to side.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''But behind all the bronze and brawn, there's a man I could see by my side when this is all over. If we survive.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The two of you fighting Athenians on the beach sounds romantic. I'd hate to interfere.''\nKyra kissed Kassandra on the cheek.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWe could all be dead tomorrow.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These are dangerous times. I'd hate to meet [[Hades]] without having tasted those lips.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Very poetic for someone covered in blood. I like it.''\nKyra kissed Kassandra on the cheek.\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Would you even recognize me in the [[underworld]], I wonder?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI won't tell.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I won't tell Thaletas if you don't.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''You're a bold one. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't tempting.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're the one who threatened to kiss me.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''Threatened?! I don't threaten, ''misthios''. I act.''\n}}\n|-|Don't kiss me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The job is done. Payment is my reward.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''[[Drachma|Coins]] are as cold as death, ''misthios''. They soothe me as well.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We should probably move. They're going to come looking for us.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I don't think I've ever really said thank you for coming here. You've given us hope.''\n*'''Kyra:''' ''I'll go back to the hideout. But if you keep this up, Podarkes is as good as dead. I may finally know peace.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra looted the Silver Islands' treasury, leaving Podarkes' men without pay. Adding this to their previous loss of weapons and provisions greatly weakened Podarkes' position.",

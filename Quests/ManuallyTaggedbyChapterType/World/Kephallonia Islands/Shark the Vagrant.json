    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''[[Kreusa's husband|Civilian 1]]:''' ''[[Mercenary|Misthios]]! Fresh vegetables for your journey\u2014the juciest in [[Kephallonia]]!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not really in the market for vegetables.''\n*'''[[Kreusa|Civilian 2]]:''' ''No one is. Our stock is practically decomposing.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''We're trying to make enough [[drachmae]] to get out of Kephallonia. It's about time we moved on.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know what you mean.''\nThe couple looked at each other.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Wait. Kreusa, you think she could help us?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''I think she could.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll have to tell me what it is, first.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Are you scared of [[shark]]s, misthios?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Nothing scares me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not scared of anything.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''That makes one of us. A very hungry one swims in our way of leaving Kephallonia.''\n|-|Everyone's scared of sharks.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Have you seen their teeths?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Believe us, we have\u2014and we won't go near them again! A shark is guarding our one guaranteed way out of [[Kephallonia]].''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A shark?''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''He guards a precious necklace. We get it, sell it, and leave Kephallonia! The old [[bandit]] who found it first buried the necklace on the shore, near a [[Islet of Zeus|temple]].''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''And the fool didn't think! Water rises. Now, the necklace may as well belong to the shark. Vegetable-drachmae is all right, but necklace-drachmae is best.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I can relate.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know what it's like to want to leave Kephallonia.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Who wouldn't? We have nothing here. As many vegetables as we please, but no hope.''\n|-|I could keep the necklace.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If it's so valuable, why wouldn't I just keep it for myself?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''A good deed? A gesture of goodwill? An escape from our life of produce?''\n</tabber>\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''It's buried in a chest. If you get it for us, we'll take what we need to get out, and you can keep the rest!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. I'll kill your shark.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''You'll skewer him.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''You'll find him deep in the [[Ancient Ruins of Kranioi|Ruins of Kranioi]] down south.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Buried treasure usually has a story.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''The necklace was said to belong to [[Prokris]]\u2014you know, the wife of [[Kephalos]]. On the eve of their wedding, he gave it to her as a promise of fidelity.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, we know how that turned out.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Typical. At least he returned to Prokris in time for her death.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where on the island are these ruins?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''You know the Sunken [[Islet of Zeus]]? Find that, and you'll find the ruins.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To the shark's temple I go.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''I'll never look at another vegetable again after this.''\nKassandra travelled south near the ruins of Kranioi and found the sunken temple. With [[Ikaros]]' help, she identified the necklace held in a chest in the temple ruins.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The necklace is down there.''\nKassandra killed the sharks and dive down to loot the chest. She resurfaced and returned to the vegetable merchants, handling the necklace to the wife.\n[[File:ACOD_-_Shark_the_Vagrant_2.png|thumb|240px|The husband thanking Kassandra]]\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''You've found it! That's the necklace!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That shark put up a good fight. He must've liked it.''\nThe wife turned to her husband.\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''We can finally leave! No more vegetables.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''We'll have a new life. One far from our past.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know what that's like. Good luck.''",

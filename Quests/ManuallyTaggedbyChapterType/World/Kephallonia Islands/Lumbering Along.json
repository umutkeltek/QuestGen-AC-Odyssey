    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached Drucilla at her shop near the [[Temple of Zeus, Kephallonia|Temple of Zeus]].\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Fair is fair. Are you going to get my [[wood]]? Those fucking bandits need a thrashing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fair is fair. I'll fix your wood problem.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Finally. Markos sure is lucky he's got you as his scapegoat.''\n(If players choose \"Where are the bandits?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Any idea where these bandits are?''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''I'm not a tracker. I'm a bowyer. They're in the mountain somewhere\u2014that much I know. I'd check close to the lumber camps.''\n(If players choose \"What's special about the wood?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's plenty of trees around. Why do you need this type of wood?''\nDrucilla whispered to Kassandra.\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''I've been working on a new type of [[bow]]. It's more flexible, so it lasts longer and can fire at greater range. Only a very special type of wood that grows high in the mountains will do.''\n(If players choose \"I'll get going.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take care of the bandits.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Make sure that you do, and be quick about it.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Quit moaning.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your moaning won't get the job done any faster. I'll kill the bandits and get your fucking wood back.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''I-I know you will. Take your time finding them. I trust you.''\n|-|Have patience.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll deal with these bandits and get you the wood you need as fast as I can. Have patience, it won't take long.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Ha! If you knew how long Markos has been feeding me excuses, you wouldn't be saying that.''\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD_-_Lumbering_Along_3.png|thumb|240px|Kassandra examining the footprints]]\nKassandra travelled west to the [[Coast of Koliadai]]. Along the road, she found a whole lot of footprints. She leaned closer to investigate.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a lot of footprints. A group left this area headed west.''\nWalking up further, she found an empty cart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The cart was emptied, then left behind. The [[thief]] can't have gotten far with that much cargo.''\nKassandra looked around and found a body under a tree near the cart.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shot in the back while fleeing. Must be the work of bandits.''\nWith [[Ikaros]]' help, Kassandra found the [[Lumber Shipyard|lumberyard]] west of her location, occupied by bandits.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That must be the bandit camp I'm looking for.''\nKassandra headed towards the yard and killed the bandits. She recovered some wood from a chest and returned to Drucilla.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Aggressive approach=\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Ah, it's Markos' assistant! Bringing me the wood i need, I hope.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Assistant? I don't think so.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''I-I meant Markos' muscle! How stupid of me.''\nKassandra handed over the wood.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This will tide you over until the rest of the wood arrives in town.''\n|-|Passive approach=\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Oh, look, it's Markos' mighty champion. Don't tell me you actually did what I asked?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I tracked the bandits and sent them to [[Hades]]. Your wood should arrive in town soon.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''And you expect me to believe the word of a mercenary?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI have proof.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't expect you to believe me, so I brought this.''\nKassandra took out the wood.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here's your proof. A sample of the special wood you want so badly. These bows you're making had better be worthy of [[Apollo]] for all the trouble I've gone to.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou should be more trusting.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You really should have more faith in people. I said I'd get it done, and I did.''\nKassandra took out the wood.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I brought you some wood back to work with until the rest arrives.''\n}}\n</tabber>\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''By the gods! You sure you work with Markos? He's never once delivered on a promise. Incredible!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I might work with him, but we're nothing alike. I'm true to my word.''\n*'''Drucilla:''' ''Then take your pay. Give none to Markos.''",

You must help me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Must I?''\n*'''Davos:''' ''If you know what's good for you and your purse, you'll take pause.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm listening.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''I'm am exile from [[Athens]]... Though by looking at me, I'm sure that's impossible to believe.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You do look rich.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A successful exile, at least. Who should offer enough to keep me interested.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''You have a good eye.''\n|-|How humble.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see humility's important to you.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''When you're wealthy, you can afford to be proud.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll see how that works in convincing me to do what you need.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''My [[drachma]]e speak for themselves.''\n|-|Wealth is dangerous in Kephallonia.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your money's a siren song to bandits on [[Kephallonia]]. It won't last long.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''My drachmae aren't going anywhere... Except a portion will be paid to you if you agree to my terms.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's the problem?''\n*'''Davos:''' ''It's my brother [[Orneos]]. He's been captured by bandits! We were attacked when our ship landed. They must have smelled our wealth from across the water. I managed to escape, but he's stuck in a cage on the dock like a beast!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you want me to rescue him.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''Bring him to me with not a hair on his head disturbed, and I'll pay you well.''\n[[File:ACOD_-_A_Ship_Came_Sailing.png|thumb|240px]]\n(If players choose \"Why were you exiled?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So someone in Athens wanted you out.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''Many \"someones,\" actually. Ostracized for the same thing, Ornes and I. \"Fraud\" they called it! But that's life, isn't it? You're used to that, aren't you misthios?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What?''\n*'''Davos:''' ''A [[mercenary]]'s life isn't an honest one, of course. But don't worry! Your secret's safe with me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd watch your tongue, old man.<br />I'll rescue your brother. For a price.''\n*'''Davos:''' ''Yes yes, of course, drachmae is the only language you Kephallonians understand.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not Kephallonian.''\nKassandra head down the hill to the docks, which had been overran with bandits. After eliminating the bandits,\nKassandra approached a small cage, where a man was held in.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''Release me! I am not an animal!''\nKassandra freed the man, and escorted him back to Davos.\n*'''Civilian:''' ''How dare they lay their filthy hands on me! And you, here, a drachma for your efforts. Although you could have arrived sooner.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your brother sent me.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''I knew he'd rescue me! And how quickly he's found himself a lackey.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To be clear, I'm the one rescuing you, and if it wasn't for your brother's money I'd gladly feed you to the pigs. Now let's go. Stay close, and shut up.''\n<tabber>\n|-|They returned to Davos.\u00a0If the box near the\u00a0Orneos/civilian cage has not been looted.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see humility's important to you.''\n*'''Davos:'''\u00a0''Orneos! Reunited again!''\n*'''Civilian:'''\u00a0''I don't know where you find these ruffians, brother, but they do get the job done.''\n*'''Kassandra:'''\u00a0''This is touching, but you owe me drachmae.''\n*'''Davos:'''\u00a0''You proved yourself useful. Get yourself something nice.''\n|-|If the box near the\u00a0Orneos/civilian cage been looted first.=\n*'''Civilian:'''\u00a0''Don't think I didn't notice you looting one of my chest''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Consider\u00a0it a fee for you hubris, Malaka.''\n*'''Davos:'''\u00a0''Oh, she did bring you to me, Orneas. Let her go.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''As quickly as I can.''\n</tabber>",

    "Section_Dialogue": "While at the [[Murex Dyeing Facility]], Kassandra came across a man screaming at another.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''What have you done?! You killed my son!''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''A [[Mercenary|misthios]]? You'll be punished for what you've done.''\n*'''Ciivlian 2:''' ''I-I didn't murder your son! It wasn't me!''\nThe angry man turned towards Kassandra.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''The gods have sent you to help me, haven't they?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Tell me what you need.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This crime will not go unpunished. Tell me what you need.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''[[Nemesis (deity)|Nemesis]] has heard my cries!''\n|-|I'll help for a price.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you have drachmae, I may have a solution.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Of course. I never imagined divine intervention would come cheap.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's going on?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''My son was murdered at the murex warehouse, his head smashed in like an egg!''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''It was [[Kythera Island|Kythera]]'s leader! I heard them arguing in the warehouse.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Then why didn't you stop them? You lie!<br>Go to the warehouse and find out who killed my son, misthios. Justice must be served.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll do it.)\n[[File:ACOD Purple Pain 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra volunteers to uncover the truth]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your son's death will not go unpunished.''\n(If \"Why would Kythera's leader kill your son?\" is chosen.)\nKassandra turned to the accused man.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What evidence do you have against Kythera's leader?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Your son was fooling around with the leader's daughters\u2014all four of them!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Daughters?! I forbade him\u2014told him the leader is a fearsome and vindictive man.''\n*'''Civilian:''' ''He was blinded by their riches\u2014check the fort and you'll find the gifts they gave him!''\n(If \"Why would this man kill your son?\" is chosen.)\nKassandra turned to the accuser.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What makes you think he did it?''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''We took him in and gave him a job, but all he's done is steal from us. My boy fired him\u2014kicked him out.''\nThe accused paused for a moment.\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''I did steal, but I would never hurt someone.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Your hurt him when you betrayed him, malaka!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That doesn't mean\u00a0he killed him.''\n(If \"Where is the warehouse?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where is the warehouse located?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''At the end of the harbor. It's a bloody mess now...''\n(Leave \u2013 \"That's enough.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go to the warehouse and see what I can find.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Find out who the murderer is, misthios.<br>I'll make sure this malaka stays put.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''I'm innocent. You'll see!''\nKassandra made her way to the warehouse, with traces of the murder left behind. She investigated a bracelet left on the ground in a corner.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This bracelet looks expensive. They could be gifts from the daughters... or an attempt to frame Kythera's leader.''\n[[File:ACOD Purple Pain 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra investigating the scene of blood]]\nShe investigated a pile of blood on the ground.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not much blood, and his head was bashed in\u2014probably a [[blunt weapon]].''\nKassandra headed to an area stacked with piles of purple linen. There, she found a blooded tablet, likely the murder weapon.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the murder weapon. It's caked in dry blood\u2014heavy too. There's no way the little guy could have swung this.''\nKassandra returned to the victim's father and the accused.\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''What did you find, misthios?''\n[[File:ACOD Purple Pain 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra reveals what she found]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I searched the warehouse and found a gold bracelet and a heavy stone tablet covered in blood.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''See! I told you you'd find gifts from the leader's daughters.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''It's not proof of innocence. What's this about a stone tablet?''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Tablet? I don't know of any tablet!''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Misthios! Tell me who murdered my son\u2014this worm of Kythera's leader?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It was Kythera's leader.=\n[[File:ACOD Purple Pain 7.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra pursing the Kythera's leader]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If the fort leader is as strong as you say, only he could have lifted a tablet like the one I saw. There's no way this scrawny [[thief]] could have swung it like a weapon.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''Then kill Kythera's leader. You will be paid when he ceases to draw breath. And make it a slow, painful execution.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It will be done.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Thank you, misthios, for clearing my name.''\nKassandra tracked down the leader of Kythera, killing him and his [[guards]].\n\n|-|It was the man beside you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was him. He probably stole the bracelet himself and planted it to frame Kythera's leader.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''No! That's not -.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''I knew it! Kill him where he stands, misthios! I'll pay every last drachmae I have to watch the worm die.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With pleasure.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''You're making a mistake!''\nThe thief tried to run away but Kassandra caught up with him and killed him.\n</tabber>\n\n(If players killed the leader first, before taking the quest, there is no choice even if you investigate the warehouse.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've slain Kythera's leader. He was the one who murdered your son.''\n*'''Civilian 2:''' ''Thank you for clearing my name, misthios.''\n*'''Civilian 1:''' ''And my boy can rest in peace.''\n\n(It was the man beside you.)\n\n'''\u2022 Kassandra:''' It was him. He probably stole the bracelet himself and planted it to frame Kythera's leader.\n\n'''\u2022 Civilian 2:''' No, that's not -\n\n'''\u2022 Civilian 1:''' I knew it! Kill him where he stands, misthios! I'll pay every last drachmae I have to watch the worm die.\n\n'''\u2022 Kassandra:''' With pleasure.\n\n'''Civilian 2:''' You're making a mistake!\n\n\n(If players killed the accused civilian before discussing the evidence.)\n\n'''\u2022 Kassandra:''' Problem solved.\n\n'''\u2022 Civilian 1:''' So it was him after all. I should have gutted him myself. Thank you, misthios.",

    "Section_Trivia": "*The name of this quest is a play on the song {{Wiki|Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain}} from {{Wiki|Prince (musician)|Prince}}.\n*Kassandra can choose to either accuse the old man or the leader of the murder, although the clues likely point to the leader as the one responsible. Regardless, Kassandra will be asked to hunt down either of them. If Kassandra identified the leader as the one responsible, he can be found at either the [[Shrine of Aphrodite, Kythera|Shrine of Aphrodite]] or the [[Leader House, Kythera|Leader House]].",

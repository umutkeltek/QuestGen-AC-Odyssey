    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Gelon]], whose ship and crew had gone missing.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Off the coast of [[Kirrha]], Kassandra found a woman grumbling to herself.\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Fuck 'em, fuck 'em all. Gods, oracles, and especially pi\u2014sailors.''\nKassandra spoke to her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's your problem?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''What don't I have fucking problems with? The [[Pythia|Oracle]], for one. The sea, for another. And don't get me started on my crew.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have business with the Oracle? You're a long way from [[Sanctuary of Delphi|Delphi]].''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Had business. And my business is none of your fucking business. I ain't shopping for a [[Mercenary|merc']]. If anything, I need the gods.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I am a god.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You need a god? I'm the next best thing.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Oh, you're a live one. That's a good pitch, I'll give you that.''\n|-|Or, deal with it yourself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you want something done, you'll have to do it yourself.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''You're right there. Can't trust the gods or their servants.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So who are you?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Captain Gelon, of the ''[[Ketos Shipwreck|Shark's Tooth]]''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shark Tooth's your boat?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Do I look like a fucking fisherman? I sail a [[ship]], not a boat.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Watch your tongue.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Malaka... I came to see if you needed help.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Fuck you, no one asked you to!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know what, fuck you.''\nKassandra walked away.\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Ok. Sorry, been a bad day. I finished my business with the Oracle and was meant to meet my ship here. They're nowhere to be fucking found, and I have been here since last night.''\nKassandra walked back to Gelon.\n|-|Calm down.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was just a question. I'm here to help.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Oh, it's not your fault. After my business with the Oracle, I came to meet my ship and crew. That was a day ago, and they're nowhere to be found.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, you sought the Oracle's advice?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Her? Fuck no! I'd rather seek council in the wind from my ass.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then why seek her out?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''We got a deal. Suppose no harm in telling you. She lets me know where the pilgrims are coming from. Then I supply the transport for their journey, and we split the fee.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, you're trying to tell me the Oracle has divine intuition of where the pilgrims will be coming from.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Fuck no! She asks her \"believers\" how full their ports are, then she tells me. Simple.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have business here in Phokis?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''I got business everywhere. Right now, it's where my fucking ship.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where's the Shark Tooth?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''I wouldn't fucking be here if I knew, would i?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ok, let me rephrase. Where was the crew meant to be?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Well, um I sent my girl [[Gyke]] off. Pilgrims get stuck in the shallows 'round here, and, er, we sort of help out...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh. Your girl?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Yeah, best hand I ever had, and more. Look, find my ship and my Gyke, will you? I'll pay.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find out what happened and bring them back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do you know where they could have gone?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''The southeastern shore is pretty rich pickings. Nice cove there to trap lost, wealthy pilgrims.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're a [[Piracy|pirate]].''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''What if I am? I'm the pirate that's paying you. Anyway, I'm not a pirate all the time. It's more of a hobby.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A hobby! You sure the crew didn't mutiny and run off on you?''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Not with my Guke at the helm. Plus they never got the cut from our last trip. They wouldn't leave without getting paid.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Describe Gyke.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''She's beautiful, she is. Kisses like summer. From the first time I saw her, I wanted to eat her all up...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not helpful.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''OK, OK. She's a raven haired and has a precious band on her arm that I gave ger. Always wears it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find them and return as soon as I can.''\nKassandra travelled to the southeastern shore of the [[Hill of the Sacred War]] in [[Phokis]]. She found a shipwreck near a military [[Bulis Military Camp|camp]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's the Shark's Tooth, all right. Or what's left of her.''\nShe found a number of [[shark]]s and numerous bodies in the water. Kassandra eliminated the sharks and dived underwater. She looted the chests and recovered a bracelet on a piece of arm. Kassandra resurfaced and travelled to the nearby camp. She eliminated the soldiers and reclaimed the valuables.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should tell Gelon about Gyke.''\nKassandra returned to Gelon.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found your ship.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''And? Come on now, where are they? Where's my Gyke?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't really know how to tell you this.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''For fuck's sake, Zeus could have impregnated the whole of [[Athens]] in the time it takes you to say anything. Where are they?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're dead, all right? And your ship's gone, too.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''My Gyke...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All I found is her armband.''\nKassandra handed over the armband to Gelon.\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Gyke. Suppose I'm not much of a captain. Can't be a captain without a ship...''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Join me on my ship.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can offer you a place on my crew. I know it's not like having your own ship, but you'll be part of a family.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Hmm, well I'd rather be at sea than stuck here with these pious idiots. You got yourself a deal... Just till I'm back on my feet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Now where's your boat?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ship. It's called the [[Adrestia]].''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''Whatever you say, captain.''\n|-|I'll be on my way.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd best be on my way.''\n*'''Gelon:''' ''You do that, misthios. You may not be the cause, but nonetheless, you're the bringer of ill fate. If I never see you or that fucking Oracle again, I'll count my blessings.''\n</tabber>",

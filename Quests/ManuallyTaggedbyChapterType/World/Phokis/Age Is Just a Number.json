    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Auxesia:''' ''A [[mercenary|misthios]]! Well, aren't you a sight to my aged eyes. Young. Energetic. Perhaps I should just pay for your body instead of your help.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm not that kind of mercenary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Watch yourself. That's not my line of work.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Forgive me. I'm amazed the gods would send someone so well-suited to help me, but who is also so appealing to me physically.''\n\n|-|I've always wanted an older lover.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All things get better with age, don't they? Even you.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''The [[Pythia (431 BCE)|Oracle]] said that if I'm to live a long and happy life, I need to stay young... at heart. But I mustn't lose focus. I need your help more than your magnificent body.''\n\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad to hear it.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''[[Koragos]], my husband, is having some difficulties keeping up with my hunger for... pleasure.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I imagine any man would.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Oh, I have many lovers, but he's my soulmate. When we're together, it's indescribable.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then don't describe it.''\n*'''Auexesia:''' ''When we were younger, we would run into the moonlight forest, shed our clothes, and pleasure each other until sunrise. Our howls of ecstasy would echo throughout the valleys.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|By the gods, stop.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By the gods, woman, I said spare me the details.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''I wasn't expecting a tough-looking mercenary to be so squeamish about a little fun.''\n|-|You're a feisty one.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I hope I'm as feisty as you at your age.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''I'm feistier now than I've ever been.''\n</tabber>\n\n[[File:ACOD - Age is Just a Number 1.png|thumb|240px|Auxesia telling Kassandra of the ingredients]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What does this have to do with me?''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''I've learned of a powerful elixir, which if consumed will give someone the vigor and stamina of [[Eros]]. If you can gather me the ingredients, I can make it for my husband.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll find the ingredients... If you promise to keep your nocturnal activities to yourself.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''I have some [[drachma]]e, and Koragos has more. If you can bring me some [[bear]] scrotum and a [[deer]] tongue, I can make the elixir.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh, is that all you need?''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Don't worry, I'll reward you well. I'm sure Koragos will be thankful also.''\n(\"Where will I find a bear?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find a bear near here?''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''I heard there's a [[Bear Grotto|cave]] near the sanctuary that a large male bear has claimed.''\n(\"Where will I find a deer?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are there any deer nearby?''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''This is [[Phokis]], there's deer all over the place.''\n(\"Where did you learn this recipe?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This elixir sounds odd. Where did you learn about it?''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Why, the Pythia told me about it. She's so wise, solving a problem I didn't even know I'd have.''\n([LEAVE] \"I'll get the ingredients.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back with the ingredients soon.''\nKassandra travelled north to recover the items. She killed a bear and recovered its scrotum.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This smells awful. Who would drink an elixir made from this?''\nShe then killed a dear and recovered its tongue.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What kind of elixir uses ingredients like this?''\n[[File:ACOD_-_Age_is_Just_a_Number_3.jpg|thumb|240px|Koragos pleading with his wife about not being able to satisfy her]]\nKassandra returned to Auxesia in Sanctuary of Delphi, who was now standing with Koragos.\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Misthios, you're back. And not a moment too soon.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I got what you asked for.''\n*'''Koragos:''' ''Who is this, Auxesia?''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''This is the ''misthios'' who's going to reignite our spark, my love.''\n*'''Koragos:''' ''Oh no! We've been going through this, I can't satisfy you anymore. You're going to kill me with your lust.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Nonsense. I'm going to make you an elixir that will give you the vigor of a man a fraction of your age.''\n*'''Koragos:''' ''Gods save me. I cannot do this anymore.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Someone pay me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By all the gods, will someone just pay me? If I hear any more of this talk I'm going to be sick.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Bah! Young people. They don't understand true love. Here, this should be more than enough.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My thanks.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''Come, Koragos. I'll mix the elixir. You get the oils ready.''\n\n|-|Let me satisfy you.=\n[[File:ACOD_-_Age_is_Just_a_Number_4.jpg|thumb|240px|Kassandra following Auxesia]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your husband is tired. Allow me to satisfy your hunger.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''I've never been with a mercenary before. Very well, let's see what you're made of.''\nKassandra entered the [[Lesche of the Knidians]] with Auxesia, where they spent the whole day and night. Kassandra came out of the house.\n*'''Koragos:''' ''Did she... have fun?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That should hold her for a few days at least.''\n*'''Koragos:''' ''Thank you, misthios. Here, take this as payment. You've more than earned it.''\n\n|-|I'm glad I could help.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't need any payment. I'm just glad I could help.''\n*'''Auxesia:''' ''You are too kind, misthios. The gods have truly blessed me by crossing our paths.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You two have fun... but not too much fun.''\n\n</tabber>",

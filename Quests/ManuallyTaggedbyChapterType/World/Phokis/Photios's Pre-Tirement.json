    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Photios:''' Malaka''! If it isn't the Eagle Bearer herself. You got big since Kephallonia!''\nThe man shook hands with Kassandra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you got old. Photios the Dog's Breath! Last time I saw you, I think I lit your ship on fire.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''My [[ship]] and my beard. These days, thankfully, I've semi-retired.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Do people pay [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] here more than they did in Kephallonia.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''Course they do! Better than [[Markos]], that's for sure.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Everyone pays more than Markos. You're lucky'' I ''took all his crazy contracts.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''I was a learner\u2014he's a rotten cheat! I only accept the easy stuff now. I'm working as a watchman this very moment. A cushy job... most days.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I wish I could retire.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could use a break myself.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''Some break this is! Today feels just like old times. The job got harder than anticipated.''\n|-|You're a mercenary until the end.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Once a mercenary, always a mercenary. It's a job you can never shake off.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''Right you are. I'm learning that all the more now. Trouble goes, then comes back twice.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did something happen?''\n*'''Photios:''' ''A couple of priests ransacked this treasury. They took the [[sapphire]]s offered by a [[Thrace|Thrakian]] king, the bastards.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your employer won't like that.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''No, but you'll like this. Make an example of the [[Thief|thieves]]. You find them and the sapphires, and I'll pay you much better than you're used to in Kephallonia.''\n<tabber>\nIf sapphires have yet to be found.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. I'll help you, but...''\n*'''Photios:''' ''But what?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nNever mind the reward.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I haven't forgotten the old days. I owe you one, Photios. No reward necessary.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''Ha! I thought I was getting soft.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nMake it worth my while.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know my help doesn't come cheap, Photios.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''You were always reliable. Deadly, and drachmae hungry, but reliable.''\n}}\n(\"Where did the priests go?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, I'm hunting priests. Where do I start?''\n*'''Photios:''' ''Priests aren't used to thief business... They probably hid somewhere quiet. Check the [[Korykian Cave|caves]] west of here.''\n(\"How do you kow they were priests?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wouldn't expect priests to be jewel thieves.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''They didn't take the [[drachma]]e or the [[silver]]. They knew those sapphires were the most valuable things here. That's priest knowledge.''\n(\"I'll find the priests.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Shouldn't be long before I find them.''\nKassandra travelled west to the cave near the Sanctuary.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the cave Photios mentioned. Those priests came this way.''\n[[File:ACOD Photios's Pre-Tirement 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra in the cave mentioned by Photios]]\nKassandra entered the cave and found bandits inside. She killed the leader and discovered a corpse, recovering a note from it.\n*'''Amyris's Note:'''<br />''Agreement in full. Treasury sapphires to be sold at no discount. Meet me at [[Desphina Fort]] for sale. \u2014[[Amyris]]''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here's one of the priests. But no sign of the sapphires.''\nKassandra exited the cave through an opening and discovered Desphina Fort in the distance.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nice view. And there's the Desphina Fort to the south.''\n[[File:ACOD Photios's Pre-Tirement 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra finding the sapphires]]\nKassandra travelled to the fort and discovered the sapphires hidden in a room with [[Ikaros]]' help. She infiltrated the fort and recovered it.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here they are. A bit of blood on them, but the sapphires still shine.''\nKassandra left the fort and returned to Photios in the Sanctuary.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good news. Found the sapphires.''\nKassandra handed the sapphires to Photios.\n*'''Photios:''' ''Should I ask why they're bloody?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The priests couldn't cut it as thieves.''\n(If the player chose \"Never mind the reward.\")\n*'''Photios:''' ''You said you'd do it for free, but we both know that was horse shit. Here, take this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire, ''old man.''\n(If the player chose \"Make it worth my while.\")\n*'''Photios:''' ''If I were only a little bit younger, I might've tried to cheapen the reward a bit.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good thing you got old.''\nPhotios provided something extra.\n*'''Photios:''' ''Here's a little trinket from the treasury. No one will miss it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's hope not, or you'll send another mercenary after ''me''. Goodbye Photios.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''If you ever see that dog Markos again, tell him you demand minimum wage!''\n|-|If sapphires are already acquired.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, these sapphires are'' really ''valuable, right?''\n*'''Photios:''' ''You spawn of a salty slimeworm, you have them already, don't you? Hand them over. And don't you dare tell me I can't pay you.''\nKassandra gave him the sapphires.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Great to see you again, Photios. Savor your retirement.''\n*'''Photios:''' ''And you savor your youth! Don't become a washed-up seadog like me.''\n</tabber>",

    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "If the player does not ask for a reward or if they have obtained the sapphires before starting the memory, Photios rewards a [[Sapphire Linothorax]], a Rare breastplate.

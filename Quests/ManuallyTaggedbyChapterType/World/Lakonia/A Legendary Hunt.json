    "General_Description": "'''A Legendary Hunt''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Disregarding tradition and customs, Kassandra sought favor from the [[Two Kings of Sparta]] without a gift to give in return. Due to this, King [[Archidamos of Sparta|Archidamos]] demanded she rid [[Lakonia]] of the [[Lykaon Wolf]], said to harass farmers in the [[Dioskouroi Peninsula]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' ''The size of it... That's no ordinary wolf!<br>There it is!''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra hunted down the Lykaon Wolf and claimed its head as proof of her success. She also received the [[Wolfslayer's Breastplate]] for her efforts.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*This quest is missable. Doing [[Bully the Bullies]] and/or [[One Bad Spartan Spoils the Bunch]] quests locks this out.\n*The hero's comment when Ikaros scans the beast is the default comment available in [[The Lykaon Wolf]], immediately followed by the more generic comment for this quest. The subtitles for the second will replace the first after only a few frames, making it much more difficult to notice.\n*Though King Archidamos demands this, there are no consequences for either completing or skipping the quest.",

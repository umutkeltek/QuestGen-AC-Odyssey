    "General_Description": "'''Training Days''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra was asked by [[Xanthe]], the magistrate of [[Pitana]], to escort her son [[Makarios]] to the [[Agoge Camp North|agoge camp]] within the [[Chasms of Taygetos]] to begin his [[agoge]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra passed by a village northwest of [[Sparta]], and came upon a house atop a small hill of the village. She saw a well-dressed woman, and a boy reading on the ground nearby, under the pergola. Kassandra approached the woman.\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''You! Are you... Kassandra of House Agiad?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am.''\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''I am Xanthe, Magistrate of Pitana. I have a noble task befitting someone of your high station. My son is to start his military training at the ''agoge''. My [[Serios|husband]] is away at [[Peloponnesian War|war]], and I have official business to attend to. Can you escort him for me?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I can do this for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can escort your son to the camp master.''\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''Good. He'll learn how to be a man like his father and brother, or he'll die trying.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou'll need to pay me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But my service needs to be rewarded.''\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''Of course. You would be paid well for your time.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And they say Spartans don't speak sweetly.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI would be honored to help.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It would be my honor to take him to begin his education as a Spartan.''\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''You are an agent of Zeus.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't pretend to know the thoughts of the gods, but I'm happy to guide your son.''\n}}\n|-|Sorry, I'm busy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have no time to be your mule.''\nKassandra returns.\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''Eagle Bearer, I hope I did not offend before. It would be a great honor for my son if you could escort him to commence his military training.''\n(Back to dialogue choice one.)\n</tabber>\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''My youngest is a dreamer. His head is filled with boyhood stories. He must learn how to serve his nation first, and then his family.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's not an easy path.''\n*'''Xanthe:''' ''He will find glory as a true Spartan soldier, or die bravely in the attempt. There is no greater way to honor Sparta. You'll find the agoge camp southwest of here, near the foothills of the mountains. Makarios, come here.''\nKassandra squats down for the boy coming towards them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hello. I am Kassandra.''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''I am honored to meet you, Eagle Bearer. I can't wait to learn to fight like my brother, Theoros. And to hear all your stories of deadly monsters and glorious adventures!''\nThey left the pergola.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''This way Kassandra! The ''agoge'' is up in the mountains. So we can train closer to Olympos!''\nThey started their traveled together on foot and talked along the way.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''What's it like, being a mercenary?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I do what I must to get by.''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''My brother said the same thing about being a man in Sparta. We learn to fight, to die for our family and our country... I can't wait!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You love your home, eh?''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''I do. We are strong and we are free! And any man would happily give his life for his city, his fellow soldiers, and his children.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So how many children do you have?''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Uh, no, none... but when I'm older I'm going to marry Athena, and we'll have the strongest sons!''\nKassandra chuckles.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, then.''\nThey neared the [[Chasms of Taygetos]] down the path of the mountainside.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Do you know why a Spartan soldier can lose his helmet or spear without worry, but if he loses his shield, he is punished beyond all measure?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me.''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''It is because a soldier needs his helmet and spear to defend only himself, but his shield is dearly important for the safety of his brothers and the whole battle line.''\nThree wolves appeared and attacked them. Makarios took cover behind a rock nearby.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stay on your guard!''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Zeus save me!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stand your ground!''\nA wolf pounced on Kassandra.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Oh no, oh no, oh no...''\nShe quelled a wolf.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Ah! So fast!''\nAnd downed second one.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''I will not fear!''\nKassandra finally subdued all the wolves.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''There's so much blood!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Life ends, hot and messy.''\nThey both continued along the path.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What of your brother?''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Theoros? He's the best! He's amazing to watch in the games. He's fast and strong, and he can throw the javelin and discus farther than anyone.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh yes?''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''I'm faster than anyone my age, but Theoros is like [[Herakles]] himself!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He sounds like a god made flesh.''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''He's my hero! He even sings like [[Orpheus]]! Do you want to hear me sing? Though mother says I sing like a [[harpy]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, that's OK. I'll be glad to meet him.''\nMakarios sings a short tune regardless. Eventually, they reached the agoge camp up a slope, and Kassandra talked to the agoge master.\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire''. I bring you a new charge, Trainer.''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''Makarios, son of Serios.''\nMakarios stands attentively.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Yes sir! I can't wait to see my brother\u2014''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''Quiet, boy. No questions. You'll focus on your own lessons and duties, and speak when spoken to.''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Yes, sir.''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''You'll taste dirt and blood here. I'll force you to eat a thousand bitter lessons to harden you into the bronze shield your city needs.''\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Yes, sir.''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''Now, ''misthios'', you look like you've been in a few scrapes.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I've been in a fight or two.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A scrape or two... hundred. I like to think I've given as good as I've gotten.''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''Ha! Spoken like a true warrior. What say we give these summer youths a spectacle? Show them a clash of Titans?''\n|-|Warriors who brag tend to fall fast.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't waste breath describing my exploits or trying to scare children.''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''You speak like a Spartan. Let's see if you've learned anything else.''\n</tabber>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Sure, let's give them a spectacle.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's give these kids a show they'll sing for years.''\n|-|I'll try not to shame you too much.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm no child for you to loom over. Feel no shame when you ask for mercy, old man.''\n</tabber>\nThey fought a duel and Kassandra wins. A short while later, Iatrokles stood intact but humbled.\n*'''Makarios:''' ''Wow! What a battle! You fought like [[Atalanta]]!''\n*'''Iatrokles:''' ''Huh, you do fight with the strength of the gods.''",

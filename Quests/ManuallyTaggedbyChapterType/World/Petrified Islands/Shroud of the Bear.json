    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra found a merchant in [[Mytilene]] looking for a [[mercenary]].\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Brave misthios! I'm in need of a brave misthios!''\nKassandra approached him.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Do you have fear in your heart?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should cut out yours just for asking.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Ha! I have a lucrative job offer\u2014a dangerous one, too. If you had fear in your heart, you might not be fit for the task at hand.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I fear no one.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nobody scares me.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Ah... but I'm not talking about a person. I'm talking about the most dangerous an unpredictable creatures alive... bears.''\n|-|We all fear something.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fear is natural - it helps us survive.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Ah. But survival is never guaranteed when facing bears!''\n\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you want with them?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''I need skins to make some breastplates. The best come from [[Chios|Chios island]], north of [[Chios (city)|Chios city]]. I'll make one for you too, if you get them for me.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll do it.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get the bear skins for you.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Excellent. If you survive, I'll reward you with the finest breastplate ever created.''\n(If players choose \"Where are the bears located?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These bears. Where can I find them?''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''In the [[Hunted Forest of Artemis]], north of Chios city.''\n(Leave \u2013 I've heard enough about bears.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have the feeling you could talk about bears all day. I'll return when I have the skins.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Do hurry. I've got paying customers waiting for breastplates made from those skins.''\nKassandra left the merchant.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll need to sail to Chios island to get the bear skins.''\nKassandra departed [[Lesbos]] and sailed to Chios, approaching the forests mentioned by the merchant. After killing and skinning a bear, she commented on its texture.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The merchant was right! It's the softest fur I've ever felt.''\nAfter skinning four.\n*'''Kassandra:'''\u00a0''I'll see if the merchant can make me an entire outfit\u00a0out of these soft skins.''\nKassandra continued and skinned 2 more bears.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's all of the skins. It's time to sail back to Mytilene and collect my breastplate.''\nKassandra sailed back to the merchant in Mytilene.\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Do you have the skins?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You can have my skins.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have your bear skins.''\n*'''Street Vendor:''' ''Most impressive! Not many people have faced the majestic bear and lived to tell the tale... It's only fitting you receive a breastplate for your bravery.''\n|-|I'm keeping my skins.=\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''I\u2019m not ready to part with these skins.''\n* '''Street Vendor:''' ''Gorgeous ones like that- I can understand. But I\u2019m in desperate need of skins of my own.  Would you get more for me?''\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''I\u2019ll think about it.''\n* '''Street Vendor:''' ''Come back if you ever want to sell them.''\nThe quest will not be completed until Kassandra agrees to give the bear skins; talking to the merchant again will yield the same dialogue.\n</tabber>",

[[Bandit]]s have taken over our [[Mastic Farm|farm]] in the [[Forest of Tears]], and I fear they'll turn them into [[Slavery|slaves]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bandits typically move from place to place. They don't own farms and take slaves.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''You're right. The farm wasn't always ours. We paid the bandits for it, and when we couldn't keep up the payments...''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You should have seen it coming.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bandits are murderers and thieves. What did you think would happen?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Still... a farm for the lives of my family? I'll do anything to get them back.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Bandits don't care about what's fair.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''I can see that now.''\n|-|You had no choice.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure you had no choice...

I'm sorry I tried to hide the truth. I'll find a way to repay you if you can bring me back my sons.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll save your sons.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will help, but you should think twice before making deals with bandits in future.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Praise [[Athena]]! I will. Thank you.''\n(If \"Where is your farm?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where can I find your farm?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Our Mastic Farm is to the south of town, in the Forest of Tears.''\n(If \"Where are your boys?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where would the bandits have taken your boys?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''When the bandits freed me to collect their [[drachma]]e, my sons were locked up on our farm. One's in the house, and the other's in a supply hut out back.''\n(If \"What did you owe the bandits?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These bandits. What kind of deal did you make with them?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''They would find us a farm to work on, and we'd share the profits with them. But then we found out the farm wasn't abandoned, and the bandits had killed the previous owners.''\n(If \"How many bandits are there?\" is chosen.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These bandits. How many are they exactly?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''It all happened fast.

Go back to your mother.''\n[[File:ACOD Hostage Situation 7.png|thumb|250px|The woman thanking Kassandra for her aid]]\nHaving freed the farmer's children, Kassandra returned to her in Chios, finding that her children had returned to her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see your sons made it back to you, and those bandits won't bother you again.

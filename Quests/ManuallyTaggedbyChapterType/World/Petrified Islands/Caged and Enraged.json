    "Section_Dialogue": "While in [[Chios (city)|Chios]], Kassandra came across a woman who was held captured by a group of soldiers.\n*'''Zoe:''' ''Let me go! Let me go!<br>Let me out!''\nThe woman spotted Kassandra nearby and called out for her.\n*'''Zoe:''' ''You there! [[Artemis]] sent you to save me!''\n[[File:ACOD Caged and Enraged 2.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra freeing the captive woman]]\nKassandra attacked the guards and eliminated them, freeing the woman shortly afterwards.\n*'''Zoe:''' ''Many thanks, two-legs! It's not safe to speak here though... Meet me behind the temple in Chios city.''\nThe woman left the area. Kassandra met her later at the informed location.\n*'''Zoe:''' ''Two-legs! Over here!''\nKassandra approached her.\n*'''Zoe:''' ''Blessing to you, two-legs. I am Zoe, [[Daughters of Artemis|Daughter of Artemis]]. Thanks for freeing me from the stone-dwellers earlier.''\n(If players choose \"Why do you call me two-legs?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Two-legs? As opposed to what?''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''Our four-legged brothers and sisters, of course. We are all equal\u2014our souls are the same.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I haven't put much thought into that.''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''You should. We both have animal insticts.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I learn new things every day.''\n(If players choose \"Who are the stone-dwellers?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who are these people you call \"stone-dwellers\"?''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''They came from the west years ago, and cut down our forests and dug up our earth to build their stone buildings.''\n(I'm happy to help.)\n[[File:ACOD Caged and Enraged 3.png|thumb|250px|Zoe requesting Kassandra's help to free her wolves]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You seemed to be in a tight spot\u2014looked like you could use a hand.''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''I was outnumbered. No room to run. Now that I'm free, I can plan our revenge against the stone-dwellers.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Our revenge? Who else is involved?''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''My four-legged brothers and sisters, the woodland creatures. We'll have our revenge on the stone-dwellers, who steal from our island.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The stone-dwellers have many weapons and defense. They won't be easy targets.''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''That's why I need my furry friends. Will you free them like you freed me? In return for your help, I'll give you my finest [[Bow of the Stalker|bow]].''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll help you.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Animals shouldn't be caged.''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''I knew we were kindred spirits. My four-legged brethen are held in two camps in the deforested area. Release them all so they may run free once again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Consider it done.''\nZoe let out a cry, seemingly to her animal friends.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Her caged \"family\" is in the deforested area.''\n[[File:ACOD Caged and Enraged 4.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra at one of the camps]]\nKassandra called out for [[Ikaros]], who helped her to identify the camps the animals were held in: the [[Logging Camps]] and the [[Antigenes Camp]]. Kassandra infiltrated the first camp, finding [[wolves]] held in cages.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These wolves will want blood once released. I should be careful.''\nAfter eliminating the guards, Kassandra released the wolves one by one.\n[[File:ACOD Caged and Enraged 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra discovering Zoe's companions in cages]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Easy, four-legs. I'm a friend of Zoe's...''\nShe freed another.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nice four-legs. Don't bite\u2014I'm here to free you.''\nAfter freeing the final one, Kassandra made her way to another camp, eliminating the guards and freed the wolves afterwards. Having rescued all of them, Kassandra returned to Zoe.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've done what you've asked. Your \"family\" is free.''\n*'''Zoe:''' ''Many thanks to you, warrior of Artemis! You're worthy of this bow. May the whole world know of your deeds!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll make the most of it.''",

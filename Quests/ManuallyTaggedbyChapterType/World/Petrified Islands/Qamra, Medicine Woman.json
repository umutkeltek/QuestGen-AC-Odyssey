    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra reached a [[Vineyard, Lesbos|Vineyard]] on the island of [[Lesbos]], and overheard a farmer lamenting an ill turn of events, and a [[Doctor|healer]], [[Qamra]], trying to assuage him.\n*'''Farmer:''' ''What are we going to do...''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''Don't worry, its curable.''\nKassandra approached them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's wrong?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''My workers are sick! At this rate, I won't be able to feed my own family, never mind theirs.''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''The good news is this isn't the work of the gods, but a sickness of the body\u2014the throat in particular. I could treat the workers... if I had my medical supplies.''\nShe turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Nurse:''' [[Mercenary|Misthios]]''... Would you get them for me?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|My services aren't cheap.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you'll pay my fee... The health of your workers depends on it.''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''I'd have hoped the wellbeing of these people would be payment enough.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Yes, yes. Of course I'll reward you. Will you do it?''\n|-|I'm happy to help.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wouldn't want them to suffer.''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''Well said. Such goodwill deserves a reward, doesn't it?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Hmm... ? Oh! Of course. Of course. I have something worthwhile to trade for the service. Will you do it?''\n</tabber>\n\n:(Already found supplies and tools)\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think I might just have what you're looking for.''\n:*'''Nurse:''' ''There's no way you could have\u2014''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''See for yourself.''\n:(Dialogue continues at \"Thank you. These are specialized items...\")\n\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll get the supplies.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find your supplies.''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''Excellent. My tools are in [[Ancient Pearl]], and the [[Medicine|drugs]] are in [[Lover's Bay]].''\n(If players choose \"Where in Ancient Pearl are your tools?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ancient Pearl is pretty big. Where exactly did you leave your tools?''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''In the clinic at [[Vrisa Fort]].''\n(If players choose \"Where in Lover's Bay is the medicine?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where exactly in Lover's Bay should I look?''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''At the [[Leader House, Petrified Islands|Leader House]] in [[Mytilene]], northeast of the [[Artemis Temple|temple]].''\n(Leave \u2013 \"I'll go now.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll come back with your supplies.''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''The faster you do, the sooner I can help the workers.''\nKassandra took her leave of the two. On her way off the vineyard grounds, she decided to take care of this immediately.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go get the tools and drugs.''\nKassandra made her way south to Vrisa Fort. [[Ikaros]] surveyed the courtyards and found the clinic.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That must be Vrisa Fort.''\nKassandra infiltrated the fort and obtained the tools.<br />\n(Medical Tools obtained first)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The drugs are in the Leader House.''\n(Medical Tools obtained second)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The physician's tools.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have what the physician asked for. I should take it back to the vineyard.''\nKassandra made her way to the Leader House. Ikaros identified it at a glance.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Leader House.''\nKassandra infiltrated the Leader House and swiped the medicine from his bedchamber.<br />\n(Medicine obtained first)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She said the medical tools are in Vrisa Fort...''\n(Medicine obtained second)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These must be the drugs the physician wanted.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have what the physician asked for. I should take it back to the vineyard.''\nWith both items obtained, Kassandra returned to the Vineyard and handed the items to Qamra.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I found your supplies.''\n*'''Nurse:''' ''Thank you. These are specialized items\u2014I couldn't have replaced them in time.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''My [[grape]]s are saved!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I get the feeling that's all you've cared about from the start.''\n*'''Farmer:''' ''Without grapes, there's no work. By healing the workers, you've saved my farm! Take this.''\nKassandra was given a [[Medicinal Sash|sash]] as a reward.",

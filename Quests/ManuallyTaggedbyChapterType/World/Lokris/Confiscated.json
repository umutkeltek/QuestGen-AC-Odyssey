    "General_Description": "'''Confiscated''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "With [[Family Sword|Supideo's sword]] returned from [[Kosta]] the [[blacksmith]], Kassandra was tasked with retrieving a [[Supideo's shield|shield]] which had been [[Thief|stolen]] by a [[bandit]] [[Ailos|leader]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra walked up to the caged Supideo.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, tell me about this [[shield]].''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Well, according to my parents it was stolen while I was visiting the [[Pythia (431 BCE)|Oracle]] of [[Sanctuary of Delphi|Delphi]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stolen? It's as good as gone then.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''I overheard ''mater'' and ''pater'' whispering about it. They mentioned a cave behind the [[Red Lake]]. Talked about the thief as if they know her.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Strange.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Go to the cave, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. Bring me back my shield. Only then will my parents be truly safe from my fury. Find the cave near the Red Lake. The thief and the shield should be there.''\nKassandra left Supideo and made her way to the lake.\n[[File:ACOD-Confiscated-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra reaching the lake]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time to find this thief. Supideo mentioned a cave beyond the Red Lake. Strange that his parents knew this. They should get the shield back themselves.''\nKassandra found the Red Lake just past [[Xerxes Military Fort]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Looks like blood. I've had dreams of drowning in a lake just like this one.''\nKassandra saw a camp further along the beach. Using [[Ikaros]], she spotted the bandit leader inside a cave.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There she is!''\nKassandra stealthily moved toward the [[Red Lake Bandits]] camp and infiltrated the grounds.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This must be the cave. Perfect hiding spot for a thief.''\n[[File:ACOD-Confiscated-04.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra outside the cave]]\nKassandra subdued the bandits guarding the outer premises and positioned herself at the mouth of the cave, where she [[Eavesdropping|eavesdropped]] on Ailos talking to another bandit.\n*'''Rogue:''' ''If I see one more grain of salt, I'm going to kill someone!''\n*'''Ailos:''' ''Patience. We're going to [[raid]] that stinking village once and for all, find a [[ship]], and finally get off this salty wasteland.''\n*'''Rogue:''' ''What about that old couple? The ones you stole the shield from? We should slit their throats and take whatever they have left.''\n*'''Ailos:''' ''That family is off limits to you ''mal\u00e1kes''! If either of you touch a hair on their heads, I'm going to cut off your hands and make you do push-ups in the salt.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's my little thief.''\nKassandra attacked the pair in the cave, swiftly eliminating the rogue before turning to fight Ailos. The two dueled on the beach until Kassandra killed Ailos and looted Supideo's shield from her corpse.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This shield should be enough to protect Supideo's parents from his deadly wrath.''\n[[File:ACOD-Confiscated-05.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra returns to Supideo]]\nKassandra returned to Supideo and his parents outside the cage.\n*'''Supideo:''' Misthios''! At last! Did you find the shield?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did. Now you can protect yourselves from... the prophecy.''\n*'''[[Pedasos]]:''' ''So... you found the thief?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh yes. Cut her in half. She won't steal anything from anyone ever again.''\n*'''[[Katina]]:''' ''And what about the blacksmith?''\n<tabber>\n|-|If Kassandra romanced Kosta=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh, he's very much alive. We did things in the back of his workshop that would make [[Aphrodite]] blush!''\n*'''Katina:''' ''You didn't.''\n*'''Pedasos:''' ''This is awful.''\n*'''Supedio:''' Mater, pater'', what's wrong? You're safe\u2014the prophecy's broken.''\nKatina and Pedasos stepped towards the cage.\n*'''Katina:''' ''Actually, there's something we've been meaning to tell you. Supideo, you were adopted.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''What?!''\n*'''Katina:''' ''A young couple brought you to us. They knew we'd give you a better home. That sword and shield is your inheritance from them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait, so the ''thief''... and the blacksmith...''\n*'''Pedasos:''' ''Are Supideo's birth parents. You killed his ''mater'' and fucked his ''pater''.''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''But the prophecy said ''pater'' would scream to the [[Greek mythology|gods]] in agony.''\nKassandra smirked as she remembered her tryst with Kosta.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He screamed. But not in agony.''\nSupideo screamed in horror at the revelation. Repulsed by the truth and the imagery it sparked in his mind, he immediately ran to the salt pits after being freed from his cage.\n*'''Supideo:''' ''You killed ''mater'' and had sex with ''pater''!''\nKassandra gave chase and attempted to apologize.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Supideo, I had no idea.''\nSupideo reached a salt flat and stopped, resting his hands on his knees as his mind seized on a grisly decision.\n[[File:ACOD-Confiscated-09.jpg|thumb|250px|Supideo puts out his eyes]]\n*'''Supideo:''' ''I can't get the image out of my head. I don't want to see anymore!''\nKassandra caught up to Supideo but could only watch helplessly as he put out his eyes.\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Aargh! I'm blind, ''misthios''! Are you happy?''\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to Supideo once more.\n*'''Supdieo:''' ''My dreams are forever haunted. ''Mater'' will bleed. ''Pater'' will scream.''\n|-|If Kassandra did not romance Kosta=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's fine. Could use a cold bath, but he's fine.''\n*'''Katina:''' ''Thank the gods!''\n*'''Supideo:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios''! You spared my parents from my wrath. Now, if you would release me.''\nPedasos stepped towards the cage.\n[[File:ACOD-Confiscated-08.jpg|thumb|250px|Supideo freed from his cage]]\n*'''Pedasos:''' ''Actually there's something your ''mater'' and I have to tell you. Your parents are...''\nKatina swiftly interrupted.\n*'''Katina:''' ''Very happy to have such a caring son to protect us. Thank you, ''misthios''. We're all fine now.''\nKassandra turned to leave as Supideo was released.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Odd family.''\n</tabber>\nBefore leaving, Kassandra spoke to Pedasos and Katina once more.\n*'''Katina:''' ''It's best you left us alone. My son is very fragile.''\n*'''Pedasos:''' ''I should have never let my son go to Delphi.''",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra retrieved the shield and returned it to Supideo. However, his parents revealed the truth about his birth and Supideo realized to his horror that the Oracle's prophecy had been fulfilled despite his attempt to avert fate.",
    "Section_Behind_the_scenes": "If players chose to ignore Kosta's advances, only XP and [[drachma]]e are rewarded for this quest. If Kassandra beds him, players will receive a [[blindfold]], a piece of Epic headgear.\n\nDespite claiming to have put out his eyes, Supideo's character model still retains both after his \"blinding\". Additionally, closer inspection of the liquid leaving his face reveals that it is not eye fluid but vomited corn kernels.",

I don't think I could have survived much longer.''\n*'''Kassandra:'''\u00a0''Why were those ''mal\u00e1kas'' ''keeping you prisoner?\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''They were raving, convinced I'm the villains I play. They wanted me to lead them in a dark ceremony and tortured me to recite their spells... Nothing was enough.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're safe now.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' '' I am, but the witch has plans to harm the [[Civilian|citizens]] of [[Elis]]. She says they wronged her, so she poisoned a shipment of supplies for the city!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll have to destroy those supplies before they get there.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''But now that she knows you're here, she'll leave her hiding place and flee into the wilderness!

[[Leonidas I of Sparta|Leonidas]] and his [[Sparta]]ns wanted him dead. {{Wiki|Atossa|His own mother}} would betray him given the chance.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' '' Xerxes asking for safety... You're right, the King of [[Iran|Persia]] would never grovel. He'd crush his enemies before they could execute their plans.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad you see it that way. You should get back to Thespis.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''I will, and thank you. Xerxes will rule at last!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Happy to have helped, your majesty.''\n|-| I'll kill the witch before she escapes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't let that witch escape.

You'll be gone to [[Underworld|Hades]] soon!''\nDespite her boasting, the witch proved no match for Kassandra and was killed.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That witch is dead, thank [[Jupiter|Zeus.]]''\nWith the witch taken care of, Kassandra returned to \"Xerxes\".\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That horrible witch won't hurt anyone ever again.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''Oh, thank you! That delusional hag turned her followers against me. But now that she's dead, I should be fine. Right?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll be fine. You should go on and play your part knowing Xerxes is safe.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''You're right, Xerxes was sure of himself. A god among men!

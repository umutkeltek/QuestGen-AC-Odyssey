    "General_Description": "'''Showtime''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra faced one final challenge: the production of \"[[Leonidas]] and his 300 [[Sparta]]ns\" itself. How would she ensure the muses and the audiences were satisfied.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kasandra approached Thespis and Rhodanthe, who were sitting in front of the theater, looking worried.\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Kassandra, my muse, my helper, the one who saves my posterior. I require your assistance one last time.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've got all your actors, Thespis. Your audience is sated. So, what's the problem now?''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Leonidas himself is the problem. Picture it\u2014I was rehearsing a monologue, brandishing my shield, encouraging my soldiers. \"Come back with your shield\u00a0or under it!\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I believe that's \"with your shield or on it.\"''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''No, no, I'm sure it's under it. But just as I gestured with my shield, I slammed it into my toe. And now, I can barely stand, let alone act.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's a shame you have to cancel the play after so much work, Thespis.''\n*'''Rhodanthe:'''\u00a0''We are\u00a0''not\u00a0''cancelling the play. We'd have to give back people's drachmae.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''The show must go on. My Leonidas is right in front of me.''\nKassandra looked at Thespis, then to Rhodanthe, then realized who they meant.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What, me? I'm no actor.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''And I'm no general, but on stage, I am. Think of it. You could bring the great man's memory back to life. He could live again, through you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's my destiny. I'll play Leonidas.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''Excellent! So let's do a quick run-through of your lines. You already heard the first part\u2014\"Come back with your shield or under it.\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''On! ''On ''it.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''The next part is directed at Xerxes. \"The Persians come to make slaves of us all. I have a better idea. I say we drench the gods in wine!\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm pretty sure Leonidas said, \"Drench the gods with their blood.\"''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''I know what I wrote. Finally, when you confront the traitor. \"Today was a day the Persians will never forget. Tomorrow is a day the kings will remember!\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tomorrow is a day the ''world ''will remember.\" Leonidas battled for all of Hellas and its freedom, not just Sparta.''\n*'''Thespis:''' ''I'm sure you'll get it right. If you like, go rehearse with the rest of the cast. But if you feel ready, to the stage with you!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I need to rehearse first.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll go rehearse with my fellow actors first.''\nKassandra went behind the stage and spoke with \"Dienekes\".\n{{#tag:tabber|\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #1=\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''So good to see you. I'm sure you'll make a great Leonidas, seeing as you took care of that commander so... thoroughly.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was nothing.''\n*'''Nervous Actor''' ''So, in our scene, I'll ask you to advise the troops. Then you answer, \"Come back with your shield or under it.\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure every Spartan general says \"''on'' it.\"''\n*'''Nervous Actor''' ''That's what Thespis wrote.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #2=\n*'''Nervous Actor:''' ''It's good to see you again. I took your warning to heart, that no one can ever truly be safe. I think it can make my Dienekes more believable.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad to have helped.''\n*'''Nervous Actor''' ''So, in our scene, I'll ask you to advise the troops. Then you answer, \"Come back with your shield or under it.\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure every Spartan general says \"''on'' it.\"''\n*'''Nervous Actor''' ''That's what Thespis wrote.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #3 (Taureas)=\n*'''Taureas:''' ''I listened to you, misthios. I practiced hard, and you're going to see that hard work pay off.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I look forward to it.''\n*'''Taureas''' ''So, in our scene, I'll ask you to advise the troops. Then you answer, \"Come back with your shield or under it.\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure every Spartan general says \"''on'' it.\"''\n*'''Taureas''' ''That's what Thespis wrote.''\n}}\n\nShe went over to \"Xerxes\".\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''You're back, good. Your words stuck with me, ''misthios''. The public will fear and admire my Xerxes.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad I could inspire you.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''As King Xerxes, I'll insult you and the Spartans, the usual. So you reply, \"The Persians come to make slaves of us all. I have a better idea. I say we drench the gods with wine!\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know Thespis loves his wine, but Leonidas said he'd drench the gods with blood.''\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''He's the director, I'm sure you can make his lines work.''\n\nShe then went over to Hedone.\n\n{{#tag:tabber|\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #1 (old Hedone)=\n*'''Hedone:''' ''Hedone, good to see you. There's a lot of people out there, aren't there? I sure hope the good word of the goddess can carry me through.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure it will.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #2 (old Hedone)=\n*'''Hedone:''' ''All right, good to see you back, Hedone. I've taken your words to heart. I will spread the good word of Hedone to these glorious people.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Good to hear it.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #3 (bald Hedone)=\n*'''Hedone:''' ''Hedone, good to see you! This performance will shine with the joy of the goddess, you'll see. I trust in her to guide my words.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That could be a good plan.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}Reply #4 (bald Hedone)=\n*'''Hedone:''' ''Hedone, it's good to see you. I followed your advice and tried to make the most of this opportunity. I wouldn't want to make a fool of myself or the goddess, you know.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a good plan.''\n}}\n*'''Hedone:''' ''So I'm Ephialtes the Traitor. I'll say I'm so clever for betraying you and the Spartans. Then you say, \"Today was a day the Persians will never forget. Tomorrow is a day the kings will remember!\"''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would Thespis write that? Leonidas was a king himself, he wanted the whole world to remember what he did.''\n*'''Hedone:''' ''It's a work of art. Don't take the details too seriously.''\n\n|-|I'm ready to start the play right now.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm ready. Let's start the play.''\n</tabber>\n\nWith rehearsals done, the play commences. The Master of Ceremonies steps forward and addresses the audience. Kassandra also stepped on the stage, with a Leonidas mask.\n\n*'''Master of Ceremonies:''' ''Welcome to our play, the heroic tale of King Leonidas and His 300 Spartans. Behold your Leonidas.''\nHe pointed to \"Leonidas\".\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you for being here. Remember that Leonidas was not only a King of Sparta but the savior of all Greeks.''\n*'''\"Dienekes\":''' ''I am Dienekes, Lieutenant of the great Leonidas. I will serve him until Hades himself comes to claim him. My Commander, my king! We are outnumbered and outmaneuvered. What can I do to help?''\n*'''Master of Ceremonies:''' ''What does the Spartan general have to say to his right-hand man?''\n\n<Tabber>\n|-| Come back with your shield or under it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come back with your shield or under it.''\nThe crowd reacts poorly.\n|-| Come back with your shield or on it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come back with your shield or on it.''\nThe crowd reacts happily.\n</tabber>\n*'''\"Xerxes\":''' ''I am Xerxes, King of the Persians. You puny gods mean nothing to me. Kneel before my immortal self. You Spartan cur! I will grind you and your people under my sandal!''\n*'''Master of Ceremonies:''' ''How will Leonidas reply to his mortal enemy Xerxes?''\n\n<Tabber>\n|-| Let's drench the gods with wine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Persians come to make slaves of us all. I have a better idea. I say we drench the gods with wine!''\nThe crowd reacts poorly.\n|-| Let's drench the gods in blood.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The Persians come to make slaves of us all.

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra returned to Anais at her farm.\n*'''Anais:''' ''I'm glad you came.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you're married. Why didn't you tell me sooner?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Seeing you brought back so many fond memories, I wanted to live in them for as long as I could. Life's been hard since [[Dantos]] left.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Where did he go?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Once the war started, [[Sparta]]ns came for his [[sword]]. He was killed in battle... Leaving me to run the farm and raise our [[Arion|son]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You have a son?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Arion. I'd love for you to meet him, but he's run off again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why aren't we looking for him?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''He always goes to the same [[Den of Lykaon|cave]], where he trains to be a mighty warrior.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Your son's a true Spartan=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've never known a boy who didn't want to train to be the next Achillies.''\n|-|He shouldn't train alone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Training alone encourages bad habits.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Anais:''' ''Yes of course! You've given me an idea. You could talk to him.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Gods know he doesn't listen to his boring mother. But you've seen death up close... You could convince him to stay away from fighting and help me on the farm.''\n(Accept \u2013 I'll talk to your son.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right, I'll talk to your son.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Thank you.''\n(If players choose \"How should I introduce myself?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How should I introduce myself without scaring the boy?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Tell him you're a friend of his mother's from [[Kephallonia]]\u2014the one with the [[Ikaros|eagle]]. The stories I've told him about you are his favourites.''\n(If players choose \"What can you tell me about his father?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''is there anything about your son's father I should know to help me connect with him?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Dantos broke his finger working the fields. It healed crooked. When Arion asked about it, my husband said he was so strong as a baby, he grabbed it and snapped it like a twig. This is how we knew he was blessed by [[Herakles]].''\n(If players choose \"I'll find your son.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll find Arion.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''My husband used to take him to the cave on hunts\u2014they'd spend nights there. It's been taken over by [[wolves]] since then.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Wait, did you say wolves?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Yes, worries me sick. He calls them his \"friends,\" and believe it or not they seem protective of the boy. Please don't harm them, Kassandra. Arion would be devastated.''\n[[File:ACOD_Runaway_-_Kassandra_Enters_Cave.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra in the cave]]\nKassandra headed to the cave near [[Mount Psophis]], finding a pack of wolves guarding the entrance.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If they don't attack me, I won't attack them.''\n\nShe managed to sneak inside without harming the creatures, finding Arion on top of a cliff.\n*'''Arion:''' ''Whoa! You look like a mighty warrior.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you must be Arion. I've come to bring you home.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Why should I trust you?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm the Eagle Bearer from Kephallonia=\n(This becomes available if players asked Anais \"How should I introduce myself?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your mother and I used to get into trouble back on Kephallonia?''\n*'''Arion:''' ''Kephallonia?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'd sneak into the markets, grab as much cheese and grapes and bread as we could carry. My eagle Ikaros kept watch and warned us if there was anyone coming.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''You're Kassandra the Eagle Bearer!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your mother trusted me with the very important task of escorting you home through this dangerous forest.''\n|-|I'm a friend of your mother's.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your mother and I have known each other for a long time.

That's why I train\u2014to make these hands strong like his.''\n|-|You're right, I know nothing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right. Maybe you could tell me.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I don't want to talk about him. I want to become a warrior.''\n</tabber>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|(If Arion does trust Kassandra)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I understand, but first we need to leave this cave. The wolves are getting hungry.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''They'd never eat me. They're my friends.''\nArion began climbing down.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Um, yes, your friends. Let's go anyway, your mother misses you very much.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''If I do, could ''you'' teach me to be a mighty warrior?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We'll see. Now come.''\n|-|(If Arion does not trust Kassandra)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've spent enough time here Arion, its time to go home.''\n*'''Arion:''' ''I don't trust you.

Now Come.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nEnough is enough. Come with me now.=\nKassandra gets angry.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's enough.

Fine.''\n\nThey returned to the farm.\n*'''Anais:''' ''There you both are.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|(If the wolves were not killed)=\n*'''Arion:''' ''You didn't have to send anyone after me, mater.

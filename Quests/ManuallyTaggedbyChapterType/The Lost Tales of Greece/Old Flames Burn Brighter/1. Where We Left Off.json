    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra travelled to a small farm in [[Arkadia]] east of the [[Forest of Soron]]. There, she spotted a woman humming a tune while watering the flowers.\n\n<tabber>\n|-|You have the voice of a Siren.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your voice would have made [[Odysseus]] tear himself from the mast of his ship.''\nAnais turned around.\n*'''Anais:''' ''Who are you? What are you doing here? Speak before I cut you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gods how I've missed that temper.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Kassandra? Is it really you?''\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I'd like to sing with you.=\nKassandra hummed along with the woman, who later turned around.\n*'''Anais:''' ''You were always better with your fists than with your singing.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you're as beautiful as you were on [[Kephallonia]].''\n*'''Anais:''' ''I was covered in mud half the time. Still am. Life of a farmer I suppose.''\n|-|You were never much of a singer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's good to see after all these years, your singing voice hasn't improved.''\nAnais turned around.\n*'''Anais:''' ''Who are you? What are you doing here? Speak before I cut you!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gods how I've missed that temper.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Kassandra? Is it really you?''</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD_Where_We_Left_Off_-_Anais_and_Kassandra.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra reunited with Anais]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I got your note. How'd you know I was in Arkadia?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Everyone's hunting for the [[Mercenary|misthios]] with the broken spear and pet [[Ikaros|eagle]]. So I started a little hunt of my own.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No matter where I used to hide on Kephallonia, you were the only one who could always find me.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''That's because you were terrible at hiding.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I was better at hiding than you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Me? You're the one who couldn't hide if your life depended on it.''\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I wanted to be found.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe you only found me because I wanted you to.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Anais:''' ''Listen, we both know I was the one who was best at hiding. I'll prove it. Stay here, close your eyes, and at the count of ten come and find me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're joking.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Come, it'll be like old times. And no using Ikaros, that's cheating! Now. Close your eyes.''\nKassandra closed her eyes and begin counting. As she does so, Anais went to hide in the nearby wheat fields.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ena... Dio...Tria...Tessera...Pente...Exi...Epta...Okto...Ennea...Deka.''\nKassandra opened her eyes and turned around.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ready or not, here I come.''\nAfter a while, she found Anais.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You call this hiding?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Your tracking skills have improved.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I never liked this game.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I thought this game was silly then... and I stil think it's silly now.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''After all these years, you haven't changed one bit.''\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I couldn't wait to see you again.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It feels like forever since we've seen each other. I couldn't wait to find you.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''When did you become so charming?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Since I got your note.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Anais:''' ''Oh, this is too much fun. I want to hear everything about your life, from the day I left until now.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And I want to hear about yours.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''My story would put you to sleep. Come, let's go to the beach and talk like we used to in [[Sami]].''\nAnais and Kassandra climbed onto their [[horses]]. Kassandra then followed Anais as she headed to the beach near the [[Phigaleia Fishing Port]]. They arrived at a small altar and got off their horses.\n*'''Anais:''' ''Your life sounds so exciting... But there's something very important I need to know. Can you still hold your breath?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My breath?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''On Kephallonia you could always swim farther and deeper than anyone else. You used to bring me the most beautiful treasures from the [[Aegean Sea|sea]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don't move.''\nKassandra set off to the sea, diving down and recovered a seashell. She then resurfaced and returned to Anais.\n*'''Anais:''' ''You were under water so long, I was getting worried.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|There were sharks.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A few sharks... got in the way.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Sharks!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing I couldn't take care of.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did manage to find you this.''\nKassandra handed over the seashell.\n*'''Anais:''' ''Oh Kassandra, it's beautiful.''\nAnais then began sobbing.\n|-|Flirt \u2013 I wanted to find the perfect gift.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wasn't coming up for air until I found the perfect gift.''\nKassandra handed over the seashell.\n*'''Anais:''' ''It's beautiful. You warm my heart like the sunrise.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nMy heart broke when you left.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't know how much you meant to me until I watched you sail away.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''We're here now, together. That's all that matters.''\nThe two later spent some time together and slept. After waking up, Anais got up and began sobbing. Kassandra got up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Was it that bad?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI could warm other parts for you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your heart isn't the only thing I could warm up.''\nAnais laughs.\n*'''Anais:''' ''Has that line ever worked for you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I guess not.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI'd bring you the ocean if I could.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd bring you the whole ocean to see that smile.''\nThe two later spent some time together and slept. After waking up, Anais got up and began sobbing. Kassandra got up.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Was it that bad?''\n}}\n|-|Poseidon's no match for me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Poseidon]] and his pets couldn't get between me and my prize.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''You haven't changed. While everyone else cowers before the gods, you'd challenge them to a fistfight.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did manage to find you this.''\nKassandra handed over the seashell.\n*'''Anais:''' ''Oh Kassandra, it's beautiful.''\nAnais then began sobbing.\n</tabber>\n[[File:ACOD_Where_We_Left_Off_-_Anais_Crying.png|thumb|250px|Anais crying]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anais, what's wrong?''\n*'''Anais:''' ''Seeing you... Playing and laughing like old times. There's something I haven't told you. I'm married.''\nKassandra paused for a moment.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n*'''Anais:''' ''I should have told you sooner. I'm sorry. Meet me back at the house. I'll explain everything.''",

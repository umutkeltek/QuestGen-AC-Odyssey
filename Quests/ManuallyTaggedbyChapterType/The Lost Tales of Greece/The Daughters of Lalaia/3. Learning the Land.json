    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra met with two women near the [[Kephisos Spring]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is the whole hunting party?''\n*'''[[Erykios]]:''' ''We're all Lalaia has to spare since the [[Sons of Xerxes]] killed our husbands and sons. You must be the [[Mercenary|misthios]] Periktione hired.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am.''\n*'''[[Beroe]]:''' ''We may not be the big brutes you're used to, but we're versed in killing well enough.''\n*'''Erykios:''' ''Well, we know how to fish.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a start.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''We're ready. Do you have everything you need?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Yes. Get your bows and we'll go.''\nKassandra followed the two women on her [[horse]] as they made their way up to [[Grand Mount Parnassos|Mount Parnassos]].\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me about Lalaia.''\n*'''Erykios:''' ''We've been blessed both by the waters of [[Kephisos]] and by [[Aphrodite]] herself, for she is the source of all beauty.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''All settlement needs to be near water. Ours just has a lot.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you fish in the pools and river?''\n*'''Erykios:''' ''Kephisos provides us with what we need.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''Not enough in there to provide for all of Lalaia. That's why we need you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''With the Sons of Xerxes so close, is there less game around?''\n*'''Erykios:''' ''We've been relying more on fish and fruit. It's enough for now.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''Animals don't scream and beg for mercy the way [[humans]] do. I doubt they interest the Sons of Xerxes as much.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They're still food. Perhaps their numbers aren't as high as we think.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''They may not have enough [[Archer|archery]] to black out the [[sun]] with arrows, but they do have enough to fill every citizen of Lalaia with holes.''\nKassandra and the women reached the site.\n*'''Erykios:''' ''Here we are. A great [[bear]] is said to live nearby.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''Don't mention the bear. I'm already regretting being here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''To shoot, you need to raise your elbow to be level with your ear, keeping your arm straight and relaxed. Your arrow needs to be just below your eye, then exhale on release. Try to aim for the eye so that you don't damage the rest of the meat.''\nThe women followed Kassandra as she killed five animals in the area.\n[[File:ACOD Learning the Land 3.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra regrouping with the hunters]]\n*'''Erykios:''' ''Thank you, misthios. I've learned much from the bow. Aphrodite may provide, but [[Artemis]] acts.''\n*'''Beroe:''' ''Lalaia is such a beautiful place... I'm glad I can do my part to take care of it. Thank you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That should be enough to get you through the week. But, there's still much to be done for Lalaia.''",

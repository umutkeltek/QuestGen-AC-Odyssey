    "General_Description": "'''Blood for Aphrodite''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with Magistrate [[Periktione]] in preparation for their final battle about the [[Sons of Xerxes]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "With her task completed, Kassandra inquired with Periktione about the village's readiness.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How prepared are we?''\nBefore she could answer, a villager announced the attack.\n[[File:ACOD Blood for Aphrodite 2.png|thumb|250px|A villager warning Periktione of the Sons of Xerxes attack]]\n*'''Villager:''' ''We're under attack! [[Thyia]] and her warriors are holding them off, but we need reinforcements.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''As prepared as we're going to be. Go! I'll stay with those who can't fight.''\nKassandra took her leave and followed the villager.\n*'''Villager:''' ''This way! They've got us pinned against the rocks.''\nThey traveled up the path leading up the cliffside and met the enemy at the [[Kephisos Spring]]. While the defenders held their own, Kassandra's presence ultimately turned the tide of battle in their favor and the invaders were slain to the last man. Thyia took some wounds, but was no worse for wear. Kassandra spoke to her.\n[[File:ACOD Blood for Aphrodite 5.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra regrouping with Thyia]]\n*'''Thyia:''' ''I can't believe we did it. But the cost...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thyia, this is war.''\n:(If the [[Daughters of Artemis]] were [[Daughters of Artemis and Daughters of Aphrodite|recruited]])\n:*'''Thyia:''' ''The extra bows from the Daughters of Artemis sure helped. They took blows away from my people. For that I'm grateful.''\n:*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure they were happy to help.''\n\n(Following dialogue dependent on choices made in [[The Best Defense]])\n<tabber>\n|-|If chosen to kill scouts=\n*'''Thyia:''' ''We killed them. How? All I remember was swinging until my arms hurt, then swinging more. If you hadn't killed those scouts, I might have died thinking of them.''\n|-|If chosen to destroy caches=\n*'''Thyia:''' ''That was... well, it wasn't easy, but it was easier than I expected. The Sons of Xerxes won't be invading Lalaia anytime soon. Still, I worry about Peri back in the village.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm glad it's over.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''I may not be a champion of the gods, but it'll take more than a few wounds to fell me. Let's return to Lalaia.''\nKassandra followed Thyia back to Lalaia.\n<tabber>\n|-|Scouts killed \u2013 Periktione lives=\nThyia called out to her sister.\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Peri? Peri!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Over there.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Peri!''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''Thyia! I'm here. It's OK.''\n[[File:ACOD Blood for Aphrodite 6.png|thumb|250px|Thyia embracing her sister]]\nThyia embraced her sister.\n*'''Thyia:''' ''It's over. We beat them back. All that's left to do is burn the bodies.''\nPeriktione addressed Kassandra.\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''You protected my sister and my village, and for that I'm eternally grateful.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We protected each other.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''I don't know how we can ever repay you.''\n:(Thyia romanced)\n:*'''Thyia:''' I'' can think of a few ways I can repay you.''\n:*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''Really? You're having this discussion here? In front of your sister and the whole town?''\n:*'''Thyia:''' ''Later then.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''Gratitude, ''misthios''. Here is the drachmae as promised. You will always be welcome in Lalaia.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My [[Leonidas I of Sparta|grandfather]] died [[Hot Gates of Thermopylai|not too far]] from here. I'm glad he defended this place from the Persians.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Kassandra, if you could come see me before you leave, I'll be by the waterfall.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''And now the work of rebuilding begins.''\n\n|-|Caches destroyed \u2013 Periktione dies=\nThyia called out to her sister.\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Peri? Peri!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Over there.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Peri!''\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''Thyia! I'm so sorry. They came without warning.''\nThyia cries out in despair.\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Peri, no!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Who did this?''\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''Bandit scouts, I would guess. They carried bows and daggers.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''The scouts! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me? Now my sister is dead, and the village is awash in her blood.''\n\n{{#tag:tabber|\nWe didn't know the scouts would attack.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thyia, we couldn't be in two places at once. We got back here as soon as we could.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Not soon enough.''\n\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWe did all we could.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing I can say will make it right.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''I was supposed to be there to protect her.''\n}}\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thyia...''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''I have to visit Kephisos Spring and pray to Hades. Thank you for your help misthios. Meet me there for payment.''\n</tabber>\n\nKassandra took her leave of the magistrate and joined Thyia at the waterfall.<br />\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's good to see all this beauty at peace once again.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Periktione lives=\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Mmm. And for years to come, thanks to you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't promise you peace.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''But you did give us the tools to preserve it.''\n\n(Friendship dialogue \u2013 Did not use Flirt option during [[Sharp Lessons]])\n*'''Thyia:''' ''It was good to get to know you. I'm glad the gods smiled upon us by bringing you here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What will you do now?''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Someone needs to stay and keep Lalaia safe. I'm about to start training the children in combat. We won't be caught off guard again.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could think of no better general.''\n*'''Thyia:''' Chaire'', Kassandra of [[Sparta]]. May you have a long life.''\n\n(Romance dialogue \u2013 Used Flirt option)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, what kind of reward did you have in mind?''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''My first thoughts were of getting you out of those clothes.''\n\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFlirt \u2013 Let's undress.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If that's the first thought, I can't wait to see how the second and third thoughts go.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Oh, there won't be much thinking, but there will be seconds and thirds.''\nThe two shared an intimate moment with the waterfall in the distance.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n\nLet's take it easy.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is it alright if we just enjoy the water?''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Of course. I'd say we've both earned a rest.''\n}}\n\nRegardless, Kassandra asked Thyia what she will do next.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What will you do now?''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''With everything taken care of, I'm free to do what I want\u2014a list that includes spending more time with you.''\n\n{{#tag:tabber|\nRecruit \u2013 Join my crew.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Come with me then. I could always use someone who can think and use a sword.''\nThyia responded coyly.\n*'''Thyia:''' ''You only want me around for my brains and my brawn?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Would you prefer I said I wanted you to keep my bed warm?''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''I've lived here my whole life, to leave it... well, that would be an adventure.''\nThyia joined the crew of the ''[[Adrestia]]''.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n\nStay and protect Lalaia.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Even when your men do return, I get the feeling they'll need you to help defend Lalaia.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''They'll have to listen to me now that you've shown me that kick. Still, I'll miss you.''\n}}\n\n|-|Periktione dies=\n*'''Thyia:''' ''I don't think I'll ever be able to see the beauty again. Not without Peri.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''When I lost my own family, I didn't think I'd ever find peace.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''And have you?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Not yet. You probably want nothing to do with me now.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Everything that happened. I just can't.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I understand.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''It's better this way.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What will you do now?''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Our magistrate is dead. We are without a leader, so I will step in.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You'll make a good one.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Thank you for all your help.''\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra rallied the women of Lalaia to defend the village from the Sons of Xerxes.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*The most significant outcome of the quest (death or survival of Periktione) depends solely on the choice made during [[The Best Defense]]. Choosing to focus on weapons or armor at the end of [[The Ore of Aphrodite]] only affects the quest reward, and the Daughters of Artemis, while only recruitable after becoming their leader, are ultimately unnecessary.",

    "Section_Dialogue": "While at the village of Lalaia, Kassandra found an anxious woman near a waterfall.\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''[[Aphrodite]]. [[Artemis]]. [[Athena]]. Mothers and daughters of [[Mount Olympos|Olympous]]. Please, lead us to safety. We can't lose anyone else.''\nKassandra approached her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm none of those, but I am Kassandra, a [[Mercenary|misthios]]. What's wrong?''\n[[File:ACOD_A_Gathering_Storm_-_Periktione_Sharing_Her_Worries.png|thumb|250px|Periktione sharing her worries to Kassandra]]\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''My people are in grave danger. We lost our leaders and our warriors, and now our [[Hunting|hunters]] have disappeared.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hunting parties can be gone for weeks before returning. What happened to everyone else?''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''War. The [[Peloponnesian War|fight]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] has reached our borders, so the men left to offer their [[sword]]s. I fear that those remaining will be lost to the [[Sons of Xerxes]].''\n(If players choose \"Who are the Sons of Xerxes?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I haven't heard of the Sons of Xerxes. That's quite the name.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''[[Persia]]ns left over from the [[Battle of Thermopylae|Battle of Thermopylai]]. They have no nation except the heritage of an ancient king... But their numbers are great, and ours are not.''\n(If players choose \"You have my sympathy.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I would not trade our roles in this situation. Though killing is my specialty, and I can hunt and track.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''Do you deal in advice? I don't know how to address my people. They know something is wrong, and I'm not sure what to do about it.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|An ignorant village is unprepared.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're the leader, then act like it. High road or low road, you must still pick your path.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''You're right. I need to make preparations instead of panicking. But then there's still the missing hunting party... Would you find them for me?''\n|-|You're in a difficult position.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no easy answer. If you were to take it one step at a time, how would you start?''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''I can't bring back the men or stop the Sons of Xerxes by myself. I know it's a lot to ask, but can you bring them home? Even if it's just bones, we'll need to honor them.''\n</tabber>\n(Accept \u2013 I'll find the hunters.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll look for the missing hunters.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''My cousin [[Agnodike]] volunteered to look for them. She hasn't returned either.''\n[[File:ACOD A Gathering Storm - Kassandra escorting Agnodike.png|thumb|250px|Kassandra escorting Agnodike to safety]]\nKassandra headed up the [[Grand Mount Parnassos|mountains]] towards a [[Lamia Bandit Camp|bandit camp]] with a woman held captive. After eliminating the [[bandit]]s, Kassandra escorted the woman out of the camp to safety.\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''Those bastards. Those bastards!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you all right?''\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''Do I look all right?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You survived. It's more than we can say for your companions.''\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''That was our warning. First our hunters, then the rest of the village. I need to warn our Magistrate about the Sons of Xerxes and their plans.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And I need to see her about my payment.''\nKassandra returned to Periktione in Lalaia, who was now standing beside another [[Thyia|woman]].\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''You've returned! What news of Agnodike and the hunters?''\nAgnodike came running in.\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''Magistrate Periktione... I have grave news. The Sons of Xerxes are preparing to strike.''\nShe noticed Kassandra.\n*'''Agnodike:''' ''Oh it's you.<br />Magistrate, this misthios saved me from certain death.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For double the reward, I hope.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Finally, someone around here who knows how to use a sword! I've been trying to convince Peri to build our defenses since we first saw the Sons of Xerxes creeping closer to the village.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''This is my sister, Thyia. She considers herself to be... acting general of Lalaia in the men's absence.''\n[[File:ACOD A Gathering Storm - Thyia debating with Periktione.png|thumb|250px|Thyia disputing with Periktione]]\n*'''Thyia:''' ''It was your husband who shielded us before... Someone must do so now! Did you hear anything Agnodike said? If we wait on the gods for help we will be massacred!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The only language the Sons of Xerxes seem to understand is violence.''\n*'''Magistrate Periktione:''' ''Misthios, what if I hired you to protect the village?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do what I can.''\n*'''Thyia:''' ''Good! Meet me at [[Kephisos Spring]]. I have plans for those Sons of Xerxes.''",

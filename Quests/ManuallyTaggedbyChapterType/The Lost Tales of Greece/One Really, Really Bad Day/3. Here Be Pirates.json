Go!''\n\nWhile dispatching the first wave of pirates, a second group arrives.\n\n*'''Civilian''': ''Help us!''\n*'''Civilian''': ''I don't want to die!''\n\nAfter dispatching the second wave of pirates, a third and final group invades Alponos.\n\n*'''Kassandra''': ''Megakles! There's more coming!''\n*'''Megakles''': ''I see them!''\n\nEventually, all threats are eliminated, and Kassandra speaks to Megakles.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You fought well.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''As did you. Forget what happened before. We're alive because of you.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Combat \u2013 Now you die because of me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I am so sick of you and this cursed town.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''I'll kill you where you stand!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've killed everyone else in Alponos. What makes you so different?''\nKassandra fought and killed Megakles. She then obtained a note from his body, written by the imposter.\n|-|Time to pay up.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Don\u2019t thank me. Just pay me.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''You ''mercenaries'' are all the same. But we agreed \u2013 here is everything that was left in Alponos's treasury.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now I need to find my impersonator.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''I can help. I found this note on the pirate leader. They owe him a lot of drachmae. He was hired to sabotage the town.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Making invasion easier.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Their plan would have worked, if the ''real'' Eagle Bearer hadn't shown up. What will you do when you find him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll think of something.''\n|-|I'm glad Alponos is safe.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No need to thank me, Megakles. I'm just glad the people of Alponos are safe.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''You may not want thanks, but you deserve it. I promised everything in the treasury, and that's what you're getting.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now I need to find my impersonator.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''I can help. I found this note on the pirate leader. They owe him a lot of drachmae. He was hired to sabotage the town.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Making invasion easier.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Their plan would have worked, if the ''real'' Eagle Bearer hadn't shown up.

    "General_Description": "'''A Town in Need, Indeed''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]] and a memory of Layla herself.",
    "Section_Description": "After seemingly dispatching Alponos' pirate threat, Kassandra learned from Megakles that she had inadvertently sunk the town's supply ships. With the reinforcements dead, Kassandra is tasked to help a blacksmith, horse breeder, and \"legend\" to get Alponos' citizens prepared.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' ''The pirates are Poseidon's problem now.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''What have you done? Didn't you hear me screaming? You sunk our reinforcements!''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|They looked like pirates.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They sure looked and fought like pirates.''\n|-|You never said you had reinforcements.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You didn't say anything about reinforcements. You said pirates.''\n|-|They attacked me.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those ships attacked me. I fought back. That's what I do.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Megakles:''' ''I sent a message to the supply ships to disguise their sails. \"Look like a pirate and sail in unseen.\" Those ships had supplies and troops.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Let me make this right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If I'd known they were reinforcements, I wouldn't have attacked. I need to set this right.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''There's still time. If we can get these villagers ready for battle, they can fight off the pirates themselves.''\n|-|I'm guessing you're not a general.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not an actual general, are you?''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Not... a... Listen to me, ''misthios''. I've fought in three wars. No training prepares you for this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You had no strategy.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''These villagers are as good as slaughtered because of you. But if we can get them ready, they can fight off the pirates themselves.''\n|-|You should have said there were reinforcements.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' Now ''you tell me.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Didn't think I had to say, \"Don't sink the fucking reinforcements!\" Without those troops, we need to get these villagers ready for battle.''\n</tabber>\n\n(Then let's get ready to fight.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll do it. I don't see an armory, though. Where's the smith?''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''He hasn't worked since the last Eagle Bearer was here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get him making swords. Can the villagers ride?''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''For salt workers, they're not bad. And there's a horse breeder in town.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll talk to them.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Though we can't just arm them and tell them to fight. There's only one man who can rally the people, claims to be a reborn Ajax the Lesser. Find him and get him back.''\n\n(If players choose, \"Where can I find the smith?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where's the blacksmith?''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''The forge caught fire. The smith's in the village, but you'll need to help him rebuild before he can work again.''\n\n(If players choose, \"What about the horse breeder?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me more about the horse breeder.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''She knows horses better than Poseidon. Get her to put a mare under each of these villagers, and we'll have a chance.''\n\n(If players choose, \"What about this Ajax?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If dead heroes are anything like me, they don't like being impersonated. Are you sure this Ajax guy is a good idea?''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Let the dead judge us all they want. We need to shake the fear out of these villagers. The last time I saw Ajax, he was headed to the hills southwest of here, on the northern border of Phokis.''\n\n(If players choose, \"What do you know about my imposter?\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me what you know about the one using my name.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''He came in with a vicious little bird. Called it... Ikaros? Something like that. Anyway, said he'd help, then made things worse at every turn. So far, you two have a lot in common.''\n\n(Leave this to me.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The villagers will be warriors when I'm done.''\n\nAfter attempting to help all the citizens Megakles mentioned, Kassandra returns to him.\n*'''Megakles:''' ''You're back just in time. How's Nikaia? I heard she's trained a stallion for me.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Nikaia's dead.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nikaia's dead. She thought your horse was Pegasos and rode it right off a cliff.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''She what? All right. We don't ''need'' horses to fight if we have weapons. How many has Kallipides made?''\n|-|She's great. - Lie=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Oh, Nikaia's great. There\u2019s more horses than this village has people.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''She\u2019s as reliable as they come. And Kallipides? Has he armed the villagers?''\n</tabber>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Kallipides is dead, too.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kallipides... had an accident.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''What kind of accident?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The really bad kind. He... didn't see some stone blocks. He walked right into them, and -''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Enough. Without weapons, we're doomed.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We haven't even talked about Ajax yet.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Did you find him?''\n|-|He's made so many weapons. - Lie=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The villagers are all armed. Every single one. Nothing to worry about there.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Good! Spilling a little pirate blood on the salt might make it taste better.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You never know. Now, as for Ajax.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Tell me he inspired the villagers to make a stand.''\n</tabber>\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I found Ajax. And then he died.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ajax had this helmet that he thought would make him immortal...''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''And?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It didn't.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Malaka.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Tell me about it.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''I would ask literally anyone else, but what choice do I have? I need ''everyone'' with a blade fighting with me. You can at least ''fight'', can't you?''\n|-|We inspired the villagers together. - Lie=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ajax put on a real show. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Good! Very good. The villagers are a superstitious type.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''In this village, I can see why.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''You did good. The villagers should be able to defend their homes thanks to you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They may still need a bit of help.''\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Agreed! We can leave them to defend the village while you and I stop any pirates that are storming the Salts. What do you think?''\n</tabber>\n\n(Let's go kill pirates.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's go.''\n\n<tabber>\n(If Kassandra told him the truth)=\n*'''Megakles:''' ''Not a lot of people would have been honest with me the way you were. I respect that. I just hope there's still a chance that we can make this right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I will do everything I can to save these people.''\n|-|(If Kassandra lied to him)=\n*'''Megakles:''' ''When you sunk those ships, I thought we were as good as dead. But you did well, getting these villagers ready to fight.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Right, well... It was the least I could do.''\n</tabber>",

    "General_Description": "'''The Blind Blacksmith''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Kassandra met with [[Kallipides]], an old [[blacksmith]] living in [[Alponos]], in order to get its [[Civilian|citizens]] armed against the upcoming [[Piracy|pirate]] invasion.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra approached Kallipides' smithy and spoke to him.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you the blacksmith?''\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''I was. Then another ''misthios'', an [[Eagle]] Something, came to help. Kind young man.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm the real Eagle Bearer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's \"Eagle Bearer,\" and there's only one. Me.''\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''Ah. The one who sunk the reinforcements?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Gossip travels fast. Let's talk about the other ''misthios'', \"Eagle Something.\"''\n|-|Tell me what happened.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I heard the \"Eagle Something\" made a real mess of things.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''The poor boy lit my forge, but somehow caused the fire to erupt. Flames everywhere. I can barely see now or move my hands.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But you're the only smith in town, and pirates are coming. We need you to start making weapons.''\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''No need to worry. Old Kallipedes has a few good blades left in him. I just need some space to work. Those stone blocks would make a fine table. Could you move them for me?''\n\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll start by moving the blocks.\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds easy enough.''\n\nKassandra picked up the block.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Ugh! You could crush someone with these things if you're not careful.''\n\nKassandra set the blocks down by the step and then spoke to Kallipedes.\n\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''Excellent work! Well, what next? I suppose we can't make weapons without iron, now can we?''\n\n(\"I have iron to share.\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have more than enough to share. Have some of mine.''\n\nKassandra threw a bag of iron to Kallipedes, but as he could not see to catch it, the bag hit him in the chest and fell to the ground.\n\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''Well, this is certainly better than when that other ''misthios'' came to help. All a good smith needs ''now'' are his tools.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your tools. Really?''\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''The Eagle Something said they were stolen by a group of bad eggs. They rode west of here, but I'm not sure where.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll get them. ''Then'' you'll be ready to work?''\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''Of course! You've been so kind to this old smith. I thought I'd never work again. But your generosity has changed all that.''\n\nKassandra went to a nearby camp at [[Pyrrha Salt Pirates]] to retrieve the tools from [[bandit]]s.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would common thugs want old tools?''\n\nWhile recovering the tools, Kassandra found a farewell letter where she learned the dead bandit planned to become a blacksmith. Kassandra returned to Kallipedes.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've got your tools right here.''\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''What a day! You should be proud. You've given this old man purpose again. Now, if you could just set those aside for a moment, I'll get started.''\n\nAs Kassandra turned to leave, Kallipedes tripped on a nearby stone block.\n\n*'''Kallipedes:''' ''Woah!''\n\nKallipedes' fall shook the floor enough for a precariously-balanced shovel to fall on him. Kassandra turned around on hearing his scream as it landed.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kallipedes!''\n\nKassandra ran around the corner just in time to watch and grimace as a smelting pot fell and landed on Kallipides, killing him.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Kallipedes?''\n\nRealizing Kallipedes had died, Kassandra lowered her head and walked off as a hammer fell, crushing the corpse's head. Kassandra turned to face a nearby whimpering [[dog]].\n<tabber>\n|-|Option 1=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''By the [[Greek mythology|gods]]. I've seen a lot in my life, but that was brutal.\n|-|Option 2=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You should get out of Alponos while you can, girl. This place is cursed.''\n</tabber>\nKassandra walked away from the smithy.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Poor Kallipedes. That's... That's not good.''",

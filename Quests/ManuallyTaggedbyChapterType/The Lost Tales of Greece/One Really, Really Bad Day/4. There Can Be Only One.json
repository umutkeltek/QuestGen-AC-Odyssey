When the [[Piracy|pirates]] paid me to soften the [[Alponos|town']]<nowiki/>s defenses, I didn't think it would be so easy.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''People are dead because of you.''\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''I didn't kill anyone. But you did. We make a great team that way. I steal some tools or blow up an [[Kallipides|old man]]'s [[Blacksmith|forge]]. Send some [[Ajax the Lesser (imposter)|young idiot]] into [[bandit]]-infested mountains. \"Lose\" a general's [[Horse|steed]]. Then watch you turn it into pure chaos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The fact that Megakles and the pirates both paid you is just a bonus.''\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''Everyone pays to hear lies they want to believe.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Fight - You'll die for this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time for justice.''\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''May [[Themis|her wrath]] rain down on both of us.''\nThe mercenaries had an ominous stare down between each other.\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''[[Chikaros]]!

Even I don't play both sides like that.''\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''I can be even more impressive. You've never thought about it? What it would be like to be with the Eagle Bearer? You're not even a ''little'' curious?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFight - I'd rather kill you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Time for justice.''\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''May her wrath rain down on both of us.''\nThe mercenaries had an ominous stare down between each other.\n*'''\"Eagle Bearer\":''' ''Chikaros!

If this option is chosen, he is the only mercenary that can be recruited for the ''Adrestia'' without having to fight them before hand.",

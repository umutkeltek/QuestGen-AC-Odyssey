    "General_Description": "'''To Be Nobody''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s [[Genetic memory|genetic memories]], relived by [[Layla Hassan]] in 2018 through the [[Animus|Portable Animus HR-8.5]].",
    "Section_Description": "Following [[Barnabas]]' [[lotus]] flower inspired vision, the ''[[Adrestia]]'' set sail towards [[Anaphi]].",
    "Section_Dialogue": "As they neared Anaphi, Barnabas grew excited.\n*'''Barnabas:''' ''Those gray peaks are the mountains of Anaphi! Careful\u2014my vision showed a horrible [[cyclops]] lurking in the darkness.''\nKassandra explored the island, finding the cave of [[Drakontospilo]]. As she ventured in, torch in hand, a voice rang out of the shadows.\n*'''[[Polyphemos]]:''' ''No closer. Please.''\n{{-}}\n<tabber>\n|-|Show yourself.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Step into the light. Now!''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''No. No see me. Look different.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'm different, too.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not the only one. I've been attacked my whole life for what I am.''\nPolyphemos stepped into the light. As Kassandra noticed his discomfort at the torch's brightness, she put it out.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''You different. Like me. Friends. Me Polyphemos. You Little.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sure, \"Little.\" Polyphemos, I'm looking for a woman who was here.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''No friend for long time. You help make friend. Friend fish together. You like fish?''\n(Accept \u2013 \"Let's help each other.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So, I help you make a friend to go fishing with, and you'll help me find the woman I'm looking for.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Pretty beach! Little will see. Little will like. We go now.''\nPolyphemos rose and ran past Kassandra. She followed as he ran towards the ruins on the southern shore of the island.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little follow. Show beach where lady helped Polyphemos.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Polyphemos, this is important\u2014do you mean \"Leda\"?''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Silly Little. Not \"Lee-duh.\" \"Lay-dee.\"''\nHalf-way to the shore, they were attacked by [[Eurasian lynx|lynxes]], Polyphemos cowered in the ruins.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Help Polyphemos! No want to hurt! Never again!''\nAfter she dealt with the lynxes, they continued towards the shore.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little think Polyphemos cyclops?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're nothing like the [[Cyclops of Kephallonia|Cyclops]] from [[Kephallonia]]. He had one real eye and one [[Obsidian Eye|fake eye]]. He picked on Little.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Pick on Little! What you do?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I [[The Big Break|shoved]] his fake eye up a [[goat]]'s ass.''\nThe large man laughed at that.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little funny.''\nThey reached the remains of the village near the shore. Polyphemos hid again.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Bad men! Hate Polyphemos!''\nIn the ruins, a group of [[bandit]]s had made their camp. To put Polyphemos' mind at ease, Kassandra dealt with the bandits. The way to the shore was finally clear.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There, big guy. The beach is yours now, to fish all you want.''\nPolyphemos smiled brightly, and sat down on the rocks, enjoying the view for a moment. Then he turned to Kassandra.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little think beach pretty?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\n\u2696\ufe0fIt's a pretty beach.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Depends on who's looking at it, but sure. I think it's pretty.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''But still need friend to share. Polyphemos like poetry. Can practice with you. Tell Polyphemos what make Little, Little.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI have godlike strength.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have the strength of ten warriors. I could lift a whole mountain above my head.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Strong like Polyphemos! Careful not to crush small things. What else?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI have nice eyes.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I have eyes. They're nice, I guess.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Polyphemos know lady with pretty green eyes. She nice. What else?''\n}}\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI love to sing and drink.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Nothing makes me happier than celebrating. Drinking and singing are good for the spirit.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''With friend! Polyphemos love to sing. More?''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI like to kill.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's no better feeling in the world than crushing a skull with my fist.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little scary. Polyphemos does not hurt. Never again. More?''\n}}\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI miss my family.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I wish I could be with my family. The last time I was happy, I was a young girl. I miss those days. I don't know why I'm telling you this. You're a good listener, big guy.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI miss my crew.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I've never been able to rely on anyone the way I can rely on Barnabas and our crew. I wish my work didn't take me away from them.''\n}}\nPolyphemos finished what he was writing and stood up.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Little hurt inside. Like Polyphemos. For you.''\nHe handed her the parchment.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This is beautiful, big guy.''\nPolyphemos dug out something else.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''More gift for Little. Spices from pretty green-eye lady. Only gift Polyphemos ever got.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This might be exactly what I was looking for. So, you have a beach to go fishing...''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Only need friend.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nEnding 1=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't stay here, big guy. But if I ever meet someone who loves fishing and poetry as much as you do, I'll send them your way.''\nPolyphemos and Eurylochos smiled at each other, and set about fishing.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nEnding 2=\n(If [[Beware the Siren Call]] is completed)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I can't stay with you, big guy, but I think I found someone you should meet.''\nShe introduced [[Eurylochos]] to Polyphemos.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Eurylochos, this is Polyphemos. Polyphemos, Eurylochos.''\nPolyphemos regarded Eurylochos.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Show you cave?''\n*'''Eurylochos:''' ''Show me everything, my big friend. This is the grandest, most spectacular shore on which I've ever laid my weary eyes. I want to see it all!''\nAs Eurylochos went to admire the shore, Polyphemos addressed Kassandra one last time.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''You Little. But big heart. Take this. Special gift.''\nHe gave her a pair of [[Scaled Gauntlets]].\n}}\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n\u2694\ufe0fIt's ugly like you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Little think beach ugly. And Little think you ugly.''\nPolyphemos' face fell, and he stood up.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''You trick Polyphemos! No hurt! Please, no hurt!''\nDespite fighting Kassandra, Polyphemos continued pleading.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Please no hurt! Please!''\nKassandra slew him and found a bag of spices on him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A bag of spice. Where would he get these? I should tell Barnabas.''\n}}\n{{!}}-{{!}}\n\u2694\ufe0fI'm going to kill you.=\n(Same as previous Fight choice.)\n}}\n|-|\u2694\ufe0fI'm here to slay you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Face me, cyclops. I've come to avenge one of your victims.''\nPolyphemos stepped into the light.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Please no hurt! Polyphemos no want to fight!''\nDespite his plea, Kassandra drew her weapons and engaged.\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Please no hurt! Please!''\nEven though Polyphemos put up a fight defending himself, Kassandra managed to kill him. On his corpse, she discovered a bag of spice.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A bag of spice. Where would he get these? I should tell Barnabas.''\n|-|I come in peace.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not here to hurt you.''\n*'''Polyphemos:''' ''Everyone hurt me because look different.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nI'm different, too.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not the only one.

    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra helped Polyphemos gain a friend to fish with, and collected another clue about Leda.\n\n\"Beware the Siren Call\" will complete as soon as \"Odyssey Into the Past\" starts if players already explored the tomb, but Eurylochos will still inexplicable appear to give the \"good\" ending at the end of \"To Be Nobody\".",

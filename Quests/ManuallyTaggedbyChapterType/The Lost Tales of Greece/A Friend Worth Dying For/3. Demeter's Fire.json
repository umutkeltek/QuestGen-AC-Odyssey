        "comment": "Please stop removing it, the reference is about the play on words, maybe Demeter is about harvest but St. Elmo is about sailors, and the quest is about Barnabas and Leda which are sailors, so it seems to me that this reference is very valid and likely",

    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm doing this for you, Barnabas. I just hope you never find out.''\nAt night, Kassandra set the grain silos in [[Leda's farm]] alight.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''[[Greek mythology|Gods]] forgive me.''\n\nAfter setting the whole farm ablaze, Kassandra watched nearby. Leda rushed to the scene, shocked.\n*'''Leda:''' ''I can't believe it. Who would do this?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It was the gods.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You asked [[Demeter]] to send you a sign. I'd say this is it. She wants you to be with your father, Leda.''\n*'''Leda:''' ''Demeter is right. She always is. Staying here means living in the past. My future is on the ocean, living the life my ''[[Leda (Barnabas' wife)|mater]]'' was meant to live. You still have room for one more on your crew?''\nShe offered her hand, and Kassandra clasped it with a smile.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Welcome aboard.''\n|-|I did it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was me. I did it for Barnabas and I did it for you.''\nLeda looked at her, aghast.\n*'''Leda:''' ''I... After everything I worked for, everything I fought for. I will find a way to rebuild. And I will get my vengeance. Until then, get off my farm and ''never'' come back.''\nLeda walked off, enraged, while Kassandra looked after her.\n</tabber>",
    "Section_Outcome": "Kassandra snuck into Leda's farm and burned the grain silos to the ground. This led Leda to reconsider her life.",
    "Section_Trivia": "*This is a 'hidden' quest, in that the only way to trigger it is to set one of Leda's silos on fire.\n*It is unknown{{Cite|25 Nov 2020. Needs confirmation}} if Leda follows up on her promise to rebuild and seek vengeance if Kassandra confesses to burning the farm.\n*If players set fire to the silos before starting the quest \"[[Odyssey Into the Past]]\", the end cutscene will play immediately after completing \"[[Daddy's Home]]\".\n*Demeter's Fire is a word play on \"{{Wiki|St. Elmo's Fire}}\"",

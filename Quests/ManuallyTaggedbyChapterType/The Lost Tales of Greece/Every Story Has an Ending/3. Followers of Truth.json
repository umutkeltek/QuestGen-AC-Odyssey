    "General_Description": "'''Followers of Truth''' was a virtual representation of one of [[Kassandra]]'s genetic memories, relived by [[Layla Hassan]] through the Portable [[Animus|Animus HR-8.5]] and a memory of Layla herself.",
    "Section_Description": "[[Herodotos]] and Kassandra decided to investigate the [[Followers of Ares]] threat.",
    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra traveled to Akousmatikoi Cave, where Herodotos was waiting.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I'll follow you in after you've finished...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Killing everyone inside.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Yes. That.''\n\nAfter entering the cave, and killing 4 of the Followers, Herodotos enters.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''So this is where they've been hiding.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You were right to suggest we look here. But they've been dealt with.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''We still need to find out what they were doing here in the first place. Let's look around.''\n\nExploring around, she noticed a shield and some armor on the ground.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Athenian and Spartan uniforms...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''They could have the people of Samos believe they were attacking from either side.''\n\nA piece of paper caught her eye.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't take the Followers of Ares to be lovers of poetry.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''They're not. This work... it's awfully close to the style Theodoros uses. Why would his writings be here?''\n\nShe found a bracelet on the ground.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't take them for the heirloom type.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''How did they... That's our family's sigil.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They must have stolen it.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''There's no way they could have found that on their own. It was given to them.''\n\nShe went over to a parchment on a nearby table, also filed with severed body parts.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''There's a list of names here.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I recognize these names. They're all quite influential on Samos. But... Mestor's is missing.''\n\nShe went over to a bag of coins.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''These coins aren't like any I've seen before.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I have. They're Persian...''\n\nHaving explored enough, she went over to Herodotos.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I'm afraid to even say what I think is going on here.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|Samos is in danger.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll say it. Persia want to take Samos.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I think you're right. It's close enough to places like Athens and Sparta, but small enough to not draw their attention.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Makes sense.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Unfortunately, that's not the worst part.''\n\n|-|I want to hear your theory.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This island and these people are yours. Tell me what you're thinking.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Persia wants to take control of Samos. It'd be a good staging ground for something greater.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're right.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I only wish that was all there is to worry about.''\n\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What is it?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''If Persia is involved, they couldn't have done this alone. They would have needed someone here to help them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Someone with ties to the empire.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''And influence on Samos, yes. Other than myself, there are only two others who could be responsible. For what's going to happen... and for what already has.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Herodotos...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''With everything we've found... everything you've seen and heard. Please, just tell me which of them it is.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|It's Theodoros.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's Theodoros. He's working for the Persians and brought the Followers of Ares here.''\n\n|-|It's Mestor.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's Mestor. He brought the Followers of Ares here to help Persia.''\n\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I was afraid you'd say that, but I know you must be right.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you want to do now?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I need to talk to Theodoros.''",

    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra spoke to [[Herodotos]] aboard the ''[[Adrestia]]'' after he received a letter. His expression was one of utter sadness.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What's wrong?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''My parents...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Herodotos, I'm so sorry.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I thought I'd be able to see them again. To show them my life's work. But now... I'm sorry to ask this of you, but could you take me to [[Samos]]? I need to pay my respects.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll take you to Samos.\")\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course, my friend.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Thank you. I'm not sure I could make this trip alone.''\n\nKassandra ordered the crew to set sail for Samos. Upon their arrival, Herodotos looked at the port.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''This is it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How does it feel being back?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It feels... like... Huh. Words escape me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a first.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''To my eyes, it's home. The smells and sounds are familiar. But it's been so long. I don't know if I can do this.''\n<Tabber>\n|-|You can do this.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've done more difficult things.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Challenges we overcome always seem easier when they're behind us. What would you do?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Hold my head high. Walk with purpose. Push those feelings of doubt aside.''\n\n|-|Take your time.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Take it at your own speed. You'll get through this.''\n\nShe clasps his shoulders.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''When I hear you say it, it does feel more true.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're stronger than you know.''\n\n</tabber>\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''You're right. I suppose we should head to my family home first.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lead the way.''\n\nTogether, they walked through the docks to Herodotos' family home.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Living near the docks was so exciting as a child.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''How so?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''There was always a new ship to see. New people to watch. From the sailors, often a new word to learn. Most of which got me in trouble.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm sure your mother remembered those days fondly.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I know I do.''\n\nThe continued to walk through the docks.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''So many faces I don't recognize.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've been gone a long time.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Even so, I was hoping there'd be someone I know. Someone who'd remind me of my life before I left.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've only just arrived. It'll be OK.''\n\nOnce they arrived at the house, they entered. Several people were gathered in it.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Here we are. This is where I called home for most of my childhood.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Most?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I came to Samos at a young age, but I was born in {{Wiki|Halicarnassus|Halikarnassos}}. Those are days I'd rather not remember. Hmm. It doesn't look like it's changed much in my absence.''\n\nUpon entering, she saw a tablet on a table.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A tablet? Looks like some old writing. \"The ships never stay for long. Samos is a place people come for a visit. but not to live. Is there something about this place I don't yet see?\"''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''One of my first writings. I was always restless here, Always wanting to learn more about the world beyond and the world that was.''\n\nSearching around, she spoted a small toy on the floor.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''One of your toys?''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It was my brother's. I often hid it when he wouldn't let me play with it.''\n\nShe went over to a vase.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This pottery looks special.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''My father always felt art was a great outlet when things seemed overwhelming.''\n\n[[Mestor]] spoke up from upstairs as they duo wondered around the house.\n\n*'''Mestor:''' ''Herodotos!''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Mestor!''\n*'''Mestor:''' ''Praise the gods. It's been far too long!''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It has indeed. You're looking well.''\n\n[[Theodoros (Samian)|Theodoros]] walked in.\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''As are you, Theodoros.''\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''I can't believe you've come skulking back. After all this time...''\n\nKassandra walked away, and leaned against the wall, listening.\n\n*'''Mestor:''' ''I should go. I'm glad you're back.''\n\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''You have some nerve, little brother. You stroll back into this house when you didn't even return for the funeral. I regret ever sending you that letter.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|That's enough.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Stop it. This isn't helping.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''We came to Samos as soon as we could after receiving your letter.''\n\n|-|Calm down.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why doesn't everyone just take a deep breath...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''How could you say I didn't come back when I'm here right now? We came as soon as the letter arrived.''\n\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''You must have swam here then! It's been five moons since I sent that. And who are you exactly? How does any of this involve you?''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm a friend.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm a...''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''She's a friend.''\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''How nice. You went off to write and explore while making friends, and you left me here to take care of... everything!''\n\n|-|Watch it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm someone you don't want to upset.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''There's no need to be angry at her. She's a good friend of mine. She brought me here.''\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''I have every right to be angry, brother. You abandoned your family to pursue your dreams.''\n\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I couldn't stay here. I needed to leave.''\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''You could have taken me with you! I have things to attend to. ''One'' of us still cares about Samos.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''At least tell me where they died.''\n*'''Theodoros:''' ''We marked the spot on the nearby cliffs. Pay your respects and then leave. There's nothing for you here now.''\n\nThey both leave in different directions, with Kassandra following her friend.\n\n<Tabber>\n|-|Theodoros will come around.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Give him some time. I'm sure he's just surprised to see you.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''His eyes showed hatred.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He probably missed you. You'll see.''\n\n|-|Forget him.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He's... not like you at all.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''He means well. He's been here this whole time grieving and thinking I didn't care.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This isn't your fault. Don't let him make you feel guilty.''\n\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''It's a bit late for that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know this wasn't the welcome you were expecting.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''But perhaps it was the one I deserved. For now, I only want to see where they died. I owe that to them.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll come with you.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''I'd like that.''\n\n(Accept \u2013 \"Let's go now.\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If you're ready, we should go.''\n*'''Herodotos:''' ''Waiting to face reality will do me no good.''",

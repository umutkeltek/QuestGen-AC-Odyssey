Do you have the [[armor]] I asked for?''\n<tabber>\n(If players brought the real armor)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I have [[Diokles|your father]]'s armor, Timotheos.''\nKassandra handed him the armor.\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''That's... that's great news! Where did you find it?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I went to the [[merchant]] in town. The armor wasn't stolen, Timotheos. Your father sold it.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''That doesn't make any sense. My father wouldn't lie to me. What matters is you got the armor back. Thank you, ''misthios''. Truly.''\n|-|\n(If players brought the cheap armor)=\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''Here's the [[Athens|Athenian]] Armor''.\nKassandra handed him the armor.\n* '''Timotheos:''' ''This works. We'll be able to give him a proper burial after all.''\n* '''Kassandra:''' ''Every warrior should be buried in their nation's colors.''\n* '''Timotheos:''' ''Yes. That's true. Thank you for your help.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're welcome.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Now I just need an offering of oil for the ceremony.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll see what I can do.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Thank you. It means a lot. I should go dress my father.''\n\nLykinos ran over as Timotheos left.\n\n*'''Lykinos:''' Misthios''! Any news?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of the bandits, Lykinos.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I can breathe easier knowing my ''pater'' has been avenged. There's no chance those ''mal\u00e1kas'' had any explanation for their heinous actions?''\n<tabber>\n(If Kassandra found the reason for the bandits' actions)=\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYour father had debts.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your father owed the bandit leader Equatos quite a bit of [[drachma]]e.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''What business could he have had with that scum?''\nKassandra remained silent.\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''What matters is that they've paid for their crimes. Thank you, Kassandra''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nIt was senseless violence.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It was just a random act of violence.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Then I'm glad those monsters are dead. Thank you, Kassandra.''\n}}\n|-|\n(If Kassandra didn't find the reason for the bandits' actions)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I didn't find out why.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''All the same, I'll rest easier knowing they can't hurt anyone else. Thank you, Kassandra.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Now you can focus on mourning.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I should probably let Timotheos know about this. If you're staying for the burial, I'm sure an offering of wine would mean a great deal to my ''pater''.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos asked me to pick up oil as well. Where can I find the offerings?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''He did? I mean... You should be able to find what we need at the docks.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back soon.''\n\nShe sneaked in, and found the offerings at the [[Sea Captain's Dock]].\n<tabber>\n(If Kassandra found the oil first)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got the oil. I could get the wine... or just head back to the burial.''\n|-|\n(If Kassandra found the wine first)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Got the wine. I could get the oil... or just head back to the burial.''\n</tabber>\n(If Kassandra got both offerings)\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's both of the offerings. I should head back to the burial.''\n\nShe made her way back to the cemetery.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''How could you be so stupid? More bloodshed, Lykinos?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' Pater''<nowiki/>'s death needed vengeance. I took care of it.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''You took care of it? You really think it will end there?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Kassandra, you agree with me, right?''\n<tabber>\n|-|Lykinos is right. Revenge was necessary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lykinos is right. The bandits needed to be stopped.''\n|-|Timotheos is right. Violence creates violence.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos was right. Provoking the bandits was shortsighted.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''If I recall, you were less concerned when you were getting paid.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Someone else's father probably just died because of you. Then it'll be your head next.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''You'd like that, wouldn't you?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''What? No! Why would you say that?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''You've been nothing but cruel to me since I got here.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I'm sorry, Lykinos. I just don't want to lose you, too.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''We only have each other now that ''pater's'' gone.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''We should proceed with the burial. Did you find an offering?''\n<tabber>\n|-|I brought oil for Timotheos.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, Timotheos. An offering of oil for your father.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Thank you.''\n|-|I brought both offerings.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I brought you both what you asked for.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Then thank you from both of us.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I can thank Kassandra myself.''\n|-|I brought wine for Lykinos.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here, Lykinos. An offering of wine.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''It's perfect.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did what I could. I hope your father's journey across the [[Styx]] is peaceful.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Lykinos, come. We must prepare the altar.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''In a moment. I'd love to see you once more before you leave town. Please, find me after the ceremony.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''See you around, ''Misthios''.''\n\nKassandra watched as the ceremony began. After a while, she started walking away.",

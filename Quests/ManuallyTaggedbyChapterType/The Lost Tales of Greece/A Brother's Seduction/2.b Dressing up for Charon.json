''Would you happen to have any Athenian armor in your shop?\u00a0It's for Diokles's burial.''\n*'''Timaios:'''\u00a0''Timotheos can buy his father's armor back if he likes. Won't be cheap though.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you mean?''\n*'''Timaios:''' ''Diokles sold me his armor not too long ago.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos said his father's armor was stolen.''\n*'''Timaios:''' ''Well, I have it here and I'm no thief. I also have another set of Athenian armor. Not as nice, but it'll do for the burial.''\n\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll buy Diokles's armor.[7500]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take Diokles's armor.''\n*'''Timaios:''' ''You'll find it in the chest upstairs. Pleasure doing business with you.''\nKassandra found [[Diokles' Armor]] on the roof of the merchant's house.\n\n|-|I'll buy the cheaper armor.[250]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take the cheaper armor.''\n*'''Timaios:''' ''Figures a mercenary would choose the cheap armor. Here you go.''\nKassandra got a set of [[Standard Athenian Armor]].\n\n|-|I'll buy both.[7750]=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take both sets of armor.''\n*'''Timaios:''' ''Here's the Athenian armor. Diokles' armor is upstairs.''\nKassandra got a set of [[Standard Athenian Armor]] and found [[Diokles' Armor]] on the roof of the merchant's house.\n\n|-|Attack - Hand over the armor, or else.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Diokles' armor should belong to his son. Hand it over.''\n*'''Timaios:''' Laughs. ''You think you can threaten me? It's not like I store a set that valuable with my normal wares. You'll find it over my dead body.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's a chance I'm willing to take.''\nKassandra killed the merchant and found a set of [[Standard Athenian Armor]] on his body.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Standard Athenian armor. I could bring this back to Timotheos. Or I could look around for his father's armor.''\nIf she searched around she can also steal [[Diokles' Armor]] on the roof of the merchant's house.\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should be ready to meet Lykinos and Timotheos at the funeral.''",

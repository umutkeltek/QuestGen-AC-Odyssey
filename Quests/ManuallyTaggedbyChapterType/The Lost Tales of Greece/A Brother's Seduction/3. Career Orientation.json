    "Section_Dialogue": "Kassandra found Lykinos in his house.\n\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''My dear Kassandra! Over here. Do you have a moment? I was hoping to have the chance to thank you for all you've done.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What did you have in mind?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Poet may be my day job, but there's more to me than that. I'm also a very talented cook. Allow me to make you a fabulous meal.''\n\n(If players choose \"A meal sounds nice.\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'd like that.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Great! There's just one thing... I'll need a little help [[hunting]] down some ingredients. Literally.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're treating me, you said?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''After all we've been through together, surely you can agree that I'm a lover, not a fighter?''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're not a lover yet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A lover, huh? We'll see.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I hope so.''\n|-|You're no fighter.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''For how many [[bandit]]s I've killed for you, it's pretty safe to say you're not a fighter.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I have to compensate somehow.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What do you need me to hunt?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''This dish calls for [[Deer]]venison. Any of the beasts wandering nearby should do. Meet me at the cliffs near the [[Hypermnestra Camp]] once you find some.''\n\nKassandra found some deer nearby and killed one.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's a start, but Lykinos will need more.''\n\nShe killed another.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''This should be plenty of meat for Lykinos's dinner.''\n\nShe traveled to the cliff, and admired the view.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Beautiful view.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''It certainly is. Did you manage to hunt down our food?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Here's the meat.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Perfect, I'll get started. Please, make yourself comfortable.''\n\nAfter the meal, the two sat together as it got dark.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That was delicious.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I told you I could cook. Was the food worth it?''\n<tabber>\n|-|The company was worth it.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The company was certainly worth it. I'm having a really nice time.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I can hardly believe someone like you wants to spend time with someone like me. I have truly been blessed by the gods.''\n|-|The hunt was hardly a challenge.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''A few deer are no match for a mighty ''Misthios''.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I wish I had your skill... and confidence.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Fighter or not, I'm sure it takes a lot to be a renowned poet in Athens.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I, uh, may have exaggerated my accomplishments as a poet a bit earlier. The truth is... I'm not just home for a visit. I ran out of [[drachma]]e in [[Athens]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why lie to your brother about this? Or... to me?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''[[Timotheos]] has always been [[Diokles|my father]]'s son. In every way. They both fought for Athens. Both worked in the family business. Timotheos's path was never for me, so I left for Athens to strike out on my own.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're afraid of what he'll think.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''He'll say it was irresponsible for me to leave in the first place. And he's right, I don't have any drachmae or means to earn it.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You shouldn't give up on being a poet.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If poetry really is your passion, then you should keep at it.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''If ''you'' really think so...''\n|-|You should become a cook.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're an amazing cook, Lykinos. If you're looking for a way to make a living, you should start there.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I guess everyone needs to eat. Besides, any skill that impresses you is worth pursuing.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You never answered my question, though. Why lie to ''me'' about your career?''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Isn't it obvious? I didn't want to appear a failure to you. From the moment I met you, I knew you were amazing.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'm just a mercenary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm just someone that's had to fight everyday of my life.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Still, you saved my life, Kassandra. I'll never forget that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I'm glad I did. This has been nice, Lykinos.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''It really has.''\n|-|Flirt - You're amazing too.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You might not see it yourself, but I think you're pretty amazing, too''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Even after everything I just told you?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nPoetry is useless, anyway.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why would I care if you failed at being a poet. Poetry isn't useful.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''I may not be making any money as a poet, but it's still my passion in life.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I see.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nI like you more when you're honest.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Lykinos, I actually like you more for being honest with me.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Really?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course. I want to know the real you.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou're still cute.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Poet or not, you're still charming.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Glad you think so.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Definitely.''\n}}\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Kassandra, ever since I met you, it's as if the [[Aphrodite|weaver of wiles]] herself possessed me. I can hardly resist you.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFlirt - Then don't hold back.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''If Aphrodite's speaking, you should listen.''\nThe two kissed and spent the night together.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nWe should take this slow.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We've got time, Lykinos. Let's just enjoy the night.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''As long as you're around, I'll revel in your company.''\n}}\n|-|I am amazing.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You've barely seen what I'm capable of. I've faced trials you wouldn't believe.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''Still, you saved my life, Kassandra. I'll never forget that.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Well, I'm glad I did. This has been nice, Lykinos.''\n*'''Lykinos:''' ''It really has.''\n</tabber>",

There you are.''\n\nKassandra walked closer.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Am I interrupting?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''This is where I used to practice sparring with [[Diokles|my father]]. After he retired to the fishing business, he lost interest. But I kept up the practice on my own.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Flirt - You shouldn't train alone.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Doesn't training on your own get lonely?''\n|-|Training alone isn't a challenge.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sparring without a partner isn't a real challenge.''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Are you trying to goad me into a sparring match, [[mercenary]]?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I might be interested in some friendly competition.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I... don't think that's a good idea.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you scared, [[Athens|Athenian]]?''\n*'''Timotheos:'''  ''I just... Fine. Let's spar.''\n\n(If players choose \"Let's start.\")\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let's see what you've got.''\n\nDuring the fight, Timotheos got in a few punches.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That all you've got?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Ha! I'm just getting started.''\n\nTimotheos began taunting Kassandra.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Come on, mercenary! Keep up!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Please! You're the one slowing down.''\n\nKassandra landed some punches herself.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Filthy [[Sparta]]ns!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos, are you OK?''\n\nTimotheos was forced to his knee.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You fought well, Athenian. Timotheos?''\n\nTimotheos quickly charged her.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos, what are you doing?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I\u2014No. Stop. Stop.''\n\nHe grabbed his head.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''No! No! Stay back! Get away from me!''\n<tabber>\n|-|I'll stay back. (calming)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll stay back. I promise.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I\u2014don't know what I'll do if you get too close.''\n|-|Let me help. (aggravating)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm not going to hurt you. Let me\u2014''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Don't you get it? I might hurt you if you don't stay away!''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're not going to hurt me, Timotheos.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''You don't... you don't know that. I don't know if I could stop myself right now.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You couldn't hurt me. (aggravating)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Even if you did try to hurt me, I'm more than capable of fending you off.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''That's not... You're underestimating what I'll do when this happens.''\n|-|You won't hurt me. (calming)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I know you're stronger than whatever this is.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''When I get like this... If I lose control for even a second, the terrible things I see myself doing...''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos...''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''No, no, no. Stop. Stop!''\n<tabber>\n|-|Breathe. (calming)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just breathe.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I'm OK. I'm OK. Thank you.''\n|-|Control yourself. (aggravating)=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Just calm down.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Like it's that fucking easy!''\n</tabber>\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're safe, Timotheos. I promise.''\n\n(If Kassandra was not able to calm Timotheos down)\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I need to be alone right now. I - I'm sorry.''\n\nTimotheos left a puzzled Kassandra behind.\n(If Kassandra was able to calm Timotheos down)\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I feel... better. Thank you. Would you mind... staying with me for a moment?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Whatever you need.''\n\nAfter a while, they sat and watched the sunset.\n\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Father handled coming back from [[Peloponnesian War|the war]] so much better than I did. Any loud noise or unexpected hand on my shoulder, and my heart bursts from my chest. But he never flinched.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Did you tell him?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I couldn't bear to tell father the reason I was discharged, let alone this. I wanted to make him proud.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why were you discharged?''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''I... lost control in a battle and killed one of my comrades. My commander and I were close, so he discharged me with mania instead of charging me with treason. When I returned from the war, father never asked why. I don't know if he suspected or...''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe he was hiding his struggles the way you hid yours.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''If that's true, he was strong enough to hide it from everyone. I'm too weak to even hide it from you.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're a survivor.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Pain doesn't make you weak. Timotheos. You're a survivor.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''When the battle hasn't been won, is there really honor in coming back alive?''\nShe stood up, and lowered her hand to him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's going to be all right, Timotheos.''\nHe took her hand, and stood up. Joining her in watching the sunset.\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''For the first time, I think it might be.''\n|-|Flirt-You're strong.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Timotheos, you're a strong person. Anyone can see that.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''You think I'm strong?''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nYou're tough.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You know you're tough''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Still nice to hear you say it.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nStop fishing for compliments.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe if you stopped brooding for a second, you'd see it, too.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''My father just died.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I... You're right. Sorry''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''It's... fine.''\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nYou care about people.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Anyone who cares for people the way you do is strong, Timotheos.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''You think i'm caring.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Of course. You care for Lykinos... and others.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Others?''\n}}\nShe stood up, and lowered her hand to him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You're going to be all right, Timotheos.''\nHe took her hand, and stood up.\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Thank you. And... under normal circumstances, I would never tell you to stay away from me.''\n{{#tag:tabber|\nFlirt - Let's get closer.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''We could get closer now.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''What are we waiting for?''\nThe two kissed and spent the night together.\n{{!}}-{{!}}\nLet's stay where we are.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I think we're close enough for now.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''All right. this is nice, too.''\nKassandra turned around he joined her in watching the sunset.\n}}\n|-|Everyone carries scars.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''War isn't easy, Timotheos. Everyone comes back with wounds that never heal.''\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''Physical scars fade. I'm not sure the ones I have ever will.''\nShe stood up, and lowered her hand to him.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's going to be all right, Timotheos.''\nHe took her hand, and stood up. Joining her in watching the sunset.\n*'''Timotheos:''' ''For the first time, I think it might be.''\n</tabber>\nRegardless, Kassandra thought she should pay the two brothers a visit.\n\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should check in on Timotheos und Lykinos at their father's house.''",

What's going on?''\n*'''Man:''' ''You're the ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]'' that got involved with [[Metiochos]] and those fishermen right? One of those guys is my brother.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Uh... glad I could help?''\n*'''Man:''' ''And I heard about your speech about \"restoring the city.\" You really inspired me! Got me thinking about how to make these big, influential types pay for what they've done.''\n<tabber>\n|-|The elites shouldn't have to pay in blood.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''No, you've got it all wrong. I told those fisherman (sic) they couldn't just fight fire with fire.''\n*'''Man:''' ''You don't have to pretend with me. I know you want to take our the problematic elites so our [[Athens|city]] can be truly run by the people. Why else would you let the fishermen go? I'm doing my part.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And what is your part, exactly?''\n*'''Man:''' ''I'm hitting elites every way I can. Killing them, their wives. Even threatening their children. Only trouble is, someone got wind of the good work I'm doing for you. Now, soldiers are coming to kill me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to be the protector.''\n*'''Man:''' ''That's right.''\n(Accept - I'm going to help you.)\n|-|You better watch yourself.=\n</tabber>",

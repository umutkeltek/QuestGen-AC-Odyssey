Anything I can do to help?''\n*'''Man:''' ''You, traitor! You deserved to be killed for killing our general, Stentor of Sparta.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You're right.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I did kill Stentor. He left me no choice.''\n*'''Man:''' ''I knew it was you! I'll do what the Spartan soldiers should have done at camp!''\n(fight ensues, quest fails.)\n|-|Stentor was my brother.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The man you speak of was my brother.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Oh, I had no idea. My condolences, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''. Maybe I confused you with someone else.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe you did.''\n|-|Lie - You must have the wrong person.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I don't know anyone named Stentor. You must be thinking of someone else.''\n*'''Man:''' ''I thought I heard that the ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]'' that killed him had an [[eagle]] or something... Maybe I was wrong.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Maybe you were.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Man:''' ''Come to think of it... I did hear of another strange [[mercenary]] who arrived here recently. He must be the real traitor!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you want me to kill this mercenary.''\n*'''Man:''' ''His blood must be spilled.''\n(Accept - I'll kill the mercenary.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll handle this.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Good. Please be quick.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll come back when I'm done.''\nKassandra left the soldier and hunted down the mercenary. Afterwards, she returned to the soldier.\n*'''Man:''' ''You again. Have you killed him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your man is dead.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Thank you, mercenary. Now, your reward.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Happy to help.''",

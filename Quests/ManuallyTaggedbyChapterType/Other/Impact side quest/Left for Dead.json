And now that he's gone, I risk losing everything I have left.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Is there something I can do?''\n*'''Man:''' ''Ever since my brother disappeared, bandits have been attacking me. They're after the family fortune, and I'm left defenseless. If they take the money from me, then I can't continue my political career.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you're hoping I'll kill all the bandits?''\n*'''Man:''' ''I beg you.''\n(Accept - I'll hunt the outlaws.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. I'm in. / I'll handle this.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Get this done quickly. / Thank you. Please be discreet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can leave everything to me.''\nKassandra left the man and found the bandits' camp outside the city. She slew them all and then returned.\n*'''Man:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Excellent work, my friend. Please, take this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you.''",

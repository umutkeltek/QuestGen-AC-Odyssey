I thought you were a legend.''\n<tabber>\n|-|I am legendary.=\n\n|-|I'm just a regular mercenary.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Those legends are only stories. I am just a humble mercenary.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Man:''' ''I've heard stories about how you worked with the Spartans in [[Megaris]] and helped them to [[Battle of Megara|victory]]! I've also heard you have something to do with the [[Nikolaos|Wolf]]'s disappearance.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can't believe everything you hear.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Sadly, with the Wolf gone, fear has spread through our ranks. There's actually a small group of conspirators claiming isn't dead, but a deserter. They're alleging no one's seen his body.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's crazy. Everyone know he's dead.''\n*'''Man:''' ''That may be, but these men are convinced. They're deserting their posts and encouraging others to follow. They need to be stopped.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to kill the Spartan deserters for their dishonor.''\n*'''Man:''' ''You read me like an oracle.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take care of it.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Ha! Excellent.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Chaire.''\nKassandra left the camp and travelled to the deserters' camp, killing all the guards. She then returned to the Spartan soldier.\n*'''Man:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Good! Take this. You earned it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Happy to help.''",

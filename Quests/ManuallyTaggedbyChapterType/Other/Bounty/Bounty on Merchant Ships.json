    "Section_Description": "Kassandra noticed a bounty for [[merchant]] boats on a [[message board]]:\n#\"The [[merchant]] ring has taken control of all the trade in the harbor. They're squeezing all other trade out of the city. Feed them to the [[Great white shark|sharks]].\"\n#\"The merchant rings control the ports. Don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise. Sink the boats and don't trust anyone!\"\n#\"The merchants are the ones who keep [[Peloponnesian War|this war]] going, selling to both sides and getting fat. Sink their ships and let them sell to the fish.\"\n#\"The merchants smuggle in goods and take [[Slavery|slaves]], they fund [[Piracy|pirates]], and they play both sides of the war to make their [[drachma]]e. Sink them all.\"\n#\"These fat, stinking merchants think they control the harbor with their drachmae. Sink a few of their precious boats, and they'll remember their place.\"\n#\"What foul bargains have these merchants made to make them so bold in our waters? If [[Poseidon]] will not take them himself, you must send them to him.\"",

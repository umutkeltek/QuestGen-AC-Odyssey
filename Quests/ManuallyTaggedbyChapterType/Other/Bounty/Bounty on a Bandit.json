    "Section_Description": "Kassandra noticed a bounty for a [[bandit]] on a [[message board]]:\n#\"A bandit held me at [[knife]] point on the road into town! See how he likes getting cut open.\"\n#\"A bandit is tricking people out of [[drachma]]e by pretending to have divine sight. Go test his prophetic skills by plucking out the bastard's eyes!\"\n#\"The bandit lord has turned cannibal! It's an act against nature and against the gods. Punish this blasphemy!\"\n#\"A filthy scavenger steals from the bodies on the battlefield before they can be returned to their families. Make sure that bastard is next to fall.\"\n#\"There's a bandit in the village who makes fun of the [[soldier]]s and ridicules the [[Peloponnesian War|war effort]]. His jokes hurt the soldiers' morale. Cut the bastard in two.\"\n#\"To whomever wiped out the false gods at [[Drogarati Cave]] - those bastards took me for so much drachmae. I know of another bandit they used to work with. Finish the job, and I will have vengeance.\"",

    "Section_Messages": "The bounty posted on a [[message board]] varied, depending on the ship in question.\n*\"''The Athenian ship [[Piraeus]] keeps raiding [[Sparta]]n allies and rampaging their coastline. Someone needs to put an end to this, or many cities will succumb from attrition.''\"\n\n*\"''Athens built the [[Delos (ship)|Delos]] as a symbol of their [[Delian League|alliance]], and it galvanizes the mood of their troops. Hit them where it hurts and clear it from the horizon.''\"\n\n*\"''Athens sent its mighty [[trireme]] [[Salaminia]] to deal a massive blow to the Spartan fleet. Stop it before Athens monopolizes the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] for good.''\"\n\n*\"''[[Glory of the Law]] is one of 200 ships built under [[Themistokles]]' command. Still at sea after many battles against [[Iran|Persia]], this ship continues to terrorize coastlines. Sink it once and for all.''\"",

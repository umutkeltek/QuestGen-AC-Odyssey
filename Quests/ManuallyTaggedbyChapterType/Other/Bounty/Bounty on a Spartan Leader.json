Let the Spartans weep and wail for their dead!\"\n#\"(Leader) does nothing while the [[Wolf|wolves]] eat our children and the [[bandit]]s ravish us. Cut the face from his grinning skull.\"\n#\"(Leader) gained his power by robbing, murdering, and terrorizing poor people like me. I finally have enough for a bounty - avenge us.\"\n#\"(Leader) is the wolf at the door. He is the hunger in our belly and the hand at our throat. End our suffering. End him.\"\n#\"Sparta and its allies have known times of great plenty, but (leader) wastes our resources. He will impoverish us all if he's not stopped.\"\n#\"[[Peloponnesian War|War]] all of the time. (Leader) lives for it. Lusts for it. But even Spartans must have peace sometimes. We must be free of this tyrant.\"",

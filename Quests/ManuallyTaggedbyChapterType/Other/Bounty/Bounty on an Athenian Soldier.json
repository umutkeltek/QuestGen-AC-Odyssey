I don't have time for this Athenian who thinks he knows which end of his [[spear]] is sharp. [[Hunting|Hunt]] him.\"\n#\"One of my soldiers is useless, but his family is influential. I can't deal with him openly so I need him to have a bad run-in with a [[mercenary]].\"\n#\"The Athenian who ordered my brave son killed to cover up his own mistakes. Give him to the [[crow]]s.\"\n#\"The bastard Athenian thinks he can take whatever he wants from the poor. Well I can afford a bounty. Take from him.''(sic)''\"\n#\"We invited a soldier into our home when he was traveling, and he repaid our hospitality by stealing from us! Kill that ungracious bastard.\"",

It wasn't my place to kill him.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Woman:''' ''Well, I wholeheartedly thank you. I only wish our mercenary troubles were over.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Mercenary troubles?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I was really hoping the trouble with Heitor would teach my Himilko a lesson, but since returning home, he's gotten into trouble with yet another mercenary.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And let me guess, you want me to kill him.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I know it's a tall order, but I want this mercenary dead.''\n(Accept \u2013 \"I'll kill this mercenary.\")\n[[File:ACOD-TroubleFollows-05.jpg|thumb|250px|Kassandra fighting the mercenary.]]\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm in.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Good, please be quick.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave it to me.''\nKassandra hunted down the target, then engaged the mercenary in a duel and killed them.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Job done.''\nKassandra returned to Himilko's wife.\n*'''Woman:''' ''You again. Have you killed him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your man is dead.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''You've earned your payment, ''misthios''. Here. This is for you.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You should join my crew.=\nSeeing that Himilko seemed to always get into trouble with mercenaries, causing no end of worry for those closest to him, Kassandra offered his wife a position aboard the ''[[Adrestia]]''.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Doesn't look this life is offering you much, but another awaits aboard my ship. Sail with me \u2013 we  need someone like you.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''My family is here, ''misthios''. I can't leave them behind.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Too bad. You would have loved life on the sea.''\n|-|Thank you=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All in a day's work.''\n</tabber>",

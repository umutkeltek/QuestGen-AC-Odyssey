    "Section_Dialogue": "*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire'', statesman. I don't suppose you could use a [[mercenary]]'s help today?''\n*'''Man:''' ''You! You're the mercenary my lovely Anthousa spoke of. I've heard you have some sway with her.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''\"Your\" Anthousa? I didn't know she was tied down.''\n*'''Man:''' ''She and I have a unique connection. If she would only see it. There is someone else who's caught her eye.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Only one person?''\n*'''Man:''' ''A penniless writer who whispers empty words in Anthousa's ear. I've heard she doesn't even bestow gifts upon my love. She's clearly using her.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So where do I come into this?''\n*'''Man:''' ''Maybe if someone with Anthousa's approval found a reason to dispose of this writer, Anthousa would see clearly.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to give her a taste of my blade.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Her death is the only solution.''\n(Accept - I'll handle it.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. I'm in.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Thank you. Please be discreet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave it to me.''\nKassandra sought out the poet and dealt with her before returning to the politician.\n*'''Man:''' ''You. Have you killed her?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''She's no longer your concern.''\n*'''Man:''' ''You do fine work, mercenary. Take this as thanks.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I always finish what I've started.''",

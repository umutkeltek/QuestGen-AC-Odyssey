They can fight. But both at the same time? My [[drachma]]e's on the pirates.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sounds like I need to sink some pirate ships.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Exactly, my friend. The horizon must be cleared.''\n(Accept - I'll destroy them.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm in.''\n*'''Man:''' ''I knew I could trust you.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I should get going.''\nKassandra boarded the ''[[Adrestia]]'' and sought out pirate ships to sink.

I think blood from the hunted will please her.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to spill the beasts' blood.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Yes, all of them must be gutted. Do you accept?''\n(Accept - I'll kill the beasts.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Good. Get it done soon.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave it to me.''\nKassandra left the huntress and slew the beasts as requested before returning to her.\n*'''Woman:''' ''You're back.

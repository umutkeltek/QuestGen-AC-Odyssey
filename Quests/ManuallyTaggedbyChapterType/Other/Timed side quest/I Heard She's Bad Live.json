My [[drachma]]e to anyone who can help me get justice.''\nShe sought out the Musician and addressed her.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I picked up your message on the board. What's happening?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Uncultured fools. Swine. At least the [[Athens|Athenian]] soldiers behaved like [[human]]s.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your music wasn't popular with the Spartans?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''They spat on me. They threatened and leered. Told me to go back to the city and give birth to sons. May the crows take them and the commander who invited me to come play here.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let me guess - you need me to kill the Spartan commander?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Obviously. Do we have a deal?''\n(Accept - The commander's head is mine.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you. You have my word.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Thank the [[muses]].''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave it to me.''\nKassandra sought out the Spartan commander at his camp nearby, and slew him before returning to the Musician.\n*'''Woman:''' ''You again. Have you killed him?'' \n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your man is dead.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''You're truly a great warrior. Please take this as thanks.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you.''",

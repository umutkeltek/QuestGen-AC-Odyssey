What's happening?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''A group of [[Sparta]]n deserters just passed through. They were feverish, probably contagious. I tried to help them, but they wouldn't stop.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They sound like fools. But then again, they are deserters.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I made up some ''[[St. John's wort|hypereikon]]'' extract to treat them. But it may already be too late.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Too late?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''If they see reason and take the medicine in time, they might live.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But if they don't, they're in for agonizing deaths.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Yes. Them and anyone in the next town where they take leave.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to kill the Spartan deserters for their dishonor.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Are you up for it?''\n(Accept - Those cowards are mine.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll take care of it.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Thank you, ''misthios.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can leave everything to me.''\nKassandra sought out the deserters and slew them before returning to the herbalist.\n*'''Woman:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I knew the gods intended us to meet. Please, take this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That'll do.''",

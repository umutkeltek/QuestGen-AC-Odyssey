What's happened?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Spies from the city have been creeping through the fields and delivering supplies. I think they're planning where to set up camp.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''The [[Peloponnesian War|war]]'s not to your liking?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''When is there not war? In the city they care for war. I just want to eat. There's plenty of places they can fight without trampling my hunting grounds. I need to see those supply-running spies.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You need me to destroy the military supplies?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I knew I asked the right person.''\n(Accept - I'll destroy them.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm the one for the job.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Good. Get it done soon.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back when everything's taken care of.''\nKassandra left the woman and did as she'd asked before returning to her.\n(Missing dialogue.)",

I came across a bandit camp and they let me stay there. Even shared their wine with me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''But then they robbed you. Because they are bandits.''\n*'''Man:''' ''I figured if I was giving them [[drachma]]e to stay in the camp, they wouldn't take my drachmae. It made sense at the time. I think. No more drinking wine at bandit camps.''\n<tabber>\n|-|You want all the outlaws to be killed.=\n|-|You want the drachmae brought to you.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to get it from the bandits?''\n*'''Man:''' ''No.''\n</tabber>\n*'''Man:''' ''All the bandits must die.''\n(Accept - I'll hunt the outlaws.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you.''\n*'''Man:''' ''What a relief.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back when everything's taken care of.''\nKassandra sought out the bandit camp and killed its inhabitants before returning to the merchant.\n*'''Man:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Man:''' ''I'm a man of my word, so here's your reward.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That'll do.''",

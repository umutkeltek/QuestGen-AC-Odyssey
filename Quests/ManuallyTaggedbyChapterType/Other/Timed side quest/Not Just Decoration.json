Count yourself lucky they didn't kill you.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''This isn't an ordinary pair of earrings.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''What makes them so special? Were they a gift from a lover?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''No. The set was inscribed with an important message for the Athenian commander. It's easy to use jewelry to send secret messages. The men never bother to look.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So you want me to take it from the bandits.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''By [[Zeus]], you'd do that for me?''\n(Accept - I'll bring it to you.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you. You have my word.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Perfect. Time is of the essence.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire.\nKassandra sought out the camp of the bandits, and infiltrated it, retrieving the jewelry before returning to the woman.\n*'''Woman:''' ''Tell me it's been handled,'' misthios.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's all yours.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Job well done, mercenary. Here, this is yours.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Happy to help.''",

What's happened?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''It is time to honor Dionysos! Time to drink wine, ''[[Mercenary|misthios]]''! But there is much to prepare, and the ghosts will soon rise from the earth.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Sure they will.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I have to bring pitch to the farmer to paint his door with... it keeps the ghosts out. But game must be hunted, and goats must be slaughtered, as well.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''So... you want me to kill a bunch of goats?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Yes. All of them must be gutted. Do you accept?''\n(Accept - I'll kill the beasts.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It won't be easy, but I'll take care of it.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Good. Get it done soon.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave it to me.''\nKassandra left the woman and tracked down the goats. While she dealt with the [[wild boar]] among them, the goats fled, but returned as the scuffle died down. Kassandra slew enough of the goats, and then returned to the hunter.\n*'''Woman:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''You earned your pay, mercenary. Take this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I always finish what I've started.''",

My amulets ward of all evil!''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''My [[sword]] is protection enough.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Then I'm glad you're here. An unhappy customer is looking for me.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your amulets won't protect you?''\n*'''Man:''' ''Sometimes magic needs a helping hand.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You need me to deal with him.''\n*'''Man:''' ''The glory is all yours if you accept. Do you?''\n(Accept \u2013 I'm going to help you.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'm the one for the job.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Good. Be discreet.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll be back when everything's taken care of.''\nKassandra left to look for the soldier.

My destiny is out of my hands.''\nThe man attacked Kassandra, and she defeated him in self-defence before returning to the merchant.\n*'''Man:''' ''Has he been... dealt with,'' misthios?\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''He won't be bothering anyone anymore.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Nicely done, my friend. Please, take this as thanks.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All in a day's work.''",

He was supposed to sell a bridle to me today... I need it.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Then buy one from someone else. Why do you care that a merchant was robbed?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''This bridle... It contains secret information about [[Sparta]]'s next move, but bandits have it in their camp.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You want me to get it from the bandits?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''That's exactly it. Will you do it for me?''\n(Accept - I'll bring it to you.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''The gods are smiling on me, then.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' Chaire.\nKassandra left the spy, and located the bridle in the bandits' camp. Once it was in her possession, she returned to the spy.\n*'''Woman:''' ''Did you get it?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''It's all yours.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''Thank you for all you've done. Please, take this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That'll do.''",

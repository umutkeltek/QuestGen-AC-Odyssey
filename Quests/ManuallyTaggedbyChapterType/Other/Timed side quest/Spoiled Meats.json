What's going on?''\n*'''Man:''' ''If you've been hunting around here, please don't eat the animals you kill.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''All right. Why not?''\n*'''Man:''' ''They're diseased. Half of the countryside is sick from eating spoiled meat.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''They should know better than to eat it.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Maybe so, but people here don't have anything else. Either someone needs to take them food, or those animals need to go.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Are you asking me to slay all the animals?''\n*'''Man:''' ''Yes, all of them must be gutted. Do you accept?''\n(Accept - I'll kill the beasts.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you.''\n*'''Man:''' ''My thanks,'' misthios.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can leave everything to me.''\nKassandra left the man to hunt the [[Wolf|wolves]]. After killing enough of them, she returned to him.\n*'''Man:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Man:''' ''Good work, ''misthios''. Please, take this.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Thank you.''",

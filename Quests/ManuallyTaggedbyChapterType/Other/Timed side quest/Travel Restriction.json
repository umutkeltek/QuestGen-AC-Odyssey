What's going on?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''The soldiers and their commander who have set up camp near the village are tyrants. They control our movements and won't let us leave.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Why do you want to leave? Are you fleeing?''\n*'''Woman:''' ''No, but there are several pregnant women who live outside the village. If the soldiers keep me from helping them, they and their babies will likely die.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Let me guess. You want me to kill him.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''It's not an easy task, but yes, the Spartan must be killed./Yes, the Athenian commander must fall.''\n(Accept - The commander's head is mine.)\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll help you. You have my word.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''I'm in your debt.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I'll come back when I'm done.''\nKassandra sought out the commander and killed him before returning to the midwife.\n*'''Woman:''' ''You again. Have you killed him?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Your man is dead.''\n*'''Woman:''' ''You do good work, ''misthios''. Take this for your trouble.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That'll do.''",

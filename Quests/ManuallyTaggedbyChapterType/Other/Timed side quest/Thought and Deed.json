Is there such a thing as peace, or are there simply moments between attacks?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I prefer fighting to thinking about fighting. Get to the point.''\n*'''Philosopher:''' ''Oh, of course. A strong leader dies, and weaker, meaner leaders rise up. The commander of the nearby camp has become violent and tyrannical. He and his soldiers should learn a truth or two.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''And you want me to kill all the [[Athens|Athenians]].''\n*'''Philosopher:''' ''That would be ideal.''\n<tabber>\n|-|Those soldiers are mine.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''You can count on me.''\n*'''Philosopher:''' ''I know you'd see reason.''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''Leave it to me.''\n|-|They're not of my concern.=\nTBA\n</tabber>\nKassandra then reached the nearby camp and killed all its soldiers.\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''That's it. Now, to collect.''\nShe returned to the man.\n*'''Philosopher:''' ''You're back. Have you killed them?''\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I took care of them. Every last one.''\n*'''Philosopher:''' ''Excellent work, my friend. Please, take this.''\nThe man handled her a bag of [[drachma]]e.\n<tabber>\n|-|Recruit - You should join my crew.=\n*'''Kassandra:''' ''I could use someone with your skills. Would you consider joining my crew?''\n*'''Philosopher:''' ''You know I've seen and pondered a great many things here, but there's still so much more of the [[Greece|Greek world]] to contemplate. I'm in.''\nThe philospher joined Kassandra's crew aboard the [[Adrestia]].\n|-|Leave - Thank you.=\nTBA\n</tabber>",
